# WS-A Tier 1 Harvest: Sponsor Banks — Bancorp, Pathward/MetaBank, Green Dot

**Research Date:** 2026-04-28
**Output Label:** Derived from disclosed agreement (SEC)
**Status:** Draft — not authoritative until ML1-approved
**Extraction scope:** 5-dimension first pass (parties/roles, compliance allocation, indemnification, liability cap, termination triggers)

## Research Method Notes

Law Insider (lawinsider.com) and Justia Contracts (contracts.justia.com) used as primary sources per credit-efficient protocol. SEC EDGAR used for filing index confirmation. All sponsor bank agreements found via counterparty filings — none of the three companies filed their program management agreements as standalone EX-10 exhibits in their own annual reports. This is consistent with the pattern observed in the initial harvest (Marqeta filed the exhibit; Block disclosed body text only).

Note on Bancorp CIK: The company universe listed CIK 1359190. Confirmed correct CIK is **1295401**. Universe to be corrected.

---

## Company 1: The Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBBK)

**CIK:** 1295401 (note: universe v0.3 lists 1359190 — to be corrected)
**Filing screen result:** The Bancorp does not file standalone program management agreements as EX-10 exhibits in its own 10-K. Disclosure is body-text only in its own annual reports. Agreements appear via counterparty filings. One agreement located: Prepaid Card Issuer & Program Management Agreement filed by FiCentive/PaySign (CIK 1088034) in 2015, naming The Bancorp Bank as issuing bank. A Card Issuing Addendum with Block/Cash App (July 2025) filed via 8-K but terms confidential.

Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12659/000157484220000033/hrb20200731exhibit101.htm

**DIMENSION 2 — Compliance Responsibility Allocation**

Bank must use commercially reasonable efforts before suspending during Tax Season (seasonal operational constraint explicitly carved out).

Source: Agreement compliance provisions and suspension mechanics.

Direction: Mutual.
Scope: Same structure as Agreement 2A — mutual indemnification for breach, negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, violation of applicable law.
Carve-outs: Same three carve-outs as Agreement 2A: indemnified claims, confidentiality/security breaches, gross negligence/willful misconduct/fraud.

Source: Agreement indemnification provisions.

Named, dedicated exit right with 30-day notice. This is a bespoke regulatory trigger specific to MetaBank's regulatory economics — significant doctrine point.
De-risking / bank exit: Bank holds unilateral suspension right on regulatory/reputational/safety grounds (same structure as Agreement 2A). No commercial reasonableness obligation outside Tax Season.
Material breach cure: 30-day cure period confirmed.

## Company 3: Green Dot Corporation (NYSE: GDOT)

**CIK:** 1309108 (confirmed)
**Filing screen result:** Green Dot files standalone program agreements as EX-10 exhibits in its own 10-K. Primary agreement: 2020 Amended and Restated Walmart MoneyCard Program Agreement (EX-10.6 to FY2019 10-K). Green Dot is uniquely vertically integrated: GDC = program manager; Green Dot Bank = issuing bank; both are parties on the same side of the agreement. This produces a different disclosure structure from the MetaBank/NetSpend pattern where bank and program manager are adverse parties.

**WS-B flag — Federal Reserve consent order (July 2024):** The Federal Reserve issued a consent order against Green Dot Corporation in July 2024 imposing a $44M civil money penalty and requiring a $50M remediation fund. Identified significant BSA/AML deficiencies including inadequate transaction monitoring and customer due diligence. This is a high-value WS-B target: the consent order surfaces what Green Dot's compliance architecture failed to provide, which translates directly into implied contractual requirements. Flag for Workstream B initiation.

---

### AGREEMENT 3A

```
Filing: Green Dot Corporation / 10-K EX-10.6 / CIK 1309108 / Filed 2020 (FY2019)
Agreement title: Second Amended and Restated Walmart MoneyCard Program Agreement (2020)
Parties: Walmart Inc. (Retailer) / Green Dot Corporation / GDC (Program Manager) / Green Dot Bank (Issuing Bank — Utah chartered, Federal Reserve member, wholly-owned GDC subsidiary)
Archetype: Program Manager (vertically integrated — program manager and issuing bank are affiliates on the same side)
Output label: Derived from disclosed agreement (SEC)
```

**DIMENSION 1 — Parties and Role Labels**

Party A: Walmart Inc. — labeled "Retailer." Functional role: distribution channel, point-of-sale card activation, co-brand program sponsor, data provider.
Party B: Green Dot Corporation / GDC — labeled "Program Manager." Functional role: overall program management, regulatory and legal compliance program design and delivery.
Party C: Green Dot Bank — labeled "Issuing Bank." Functional role: Utah-chartered bank, card issuer, FDIC-insured account holder, Federal Reserve member, holds issuing regulatory relationship.
Note on structure: GDC and Green Dot Bank are affiliates (Green Dot Bank is wholly owned by GDC). Their joint and several obligations are on the same side of the agreement, facing Walmart. This is structurally different from the MetaBank/NetSpend pattern where bank and program manager are separate, unaffiliated parties.

Source: Agreement compliance provisions; Walmart indemnification carve-out for its own compliance.

**DIMENSION 3 — Indemnification**

Direction: Tri-party mutual structure.
GDC and Bank (jointly and severally) indemnify Walmart for: IP infringement, breach of agreement, negligence/willful misconduct, violation of applicable law.

GDC/Bank not obligated to cover Walmart's own compliance failures — compliance carve-out explicitly in Walmart's favor.

Source: Agreement indemnification provisions.

**DIMENSION 4 — Liability Cap Structure**

Cap structure: Not disclosed (confidential treatment). Revenue sharing formula disclosed in press releases but liability cap structure not available in filed exhibit.
Consequential loss exclusion: Not separately confirmed in available excerpt.

Change of control: Walmart termination right on GDC change of control confirmed.

## Cross-Company Observations (Preliminary — Not Doctrine)

The following observations are preliminary only. They are patterns across three agreements and do not constitute "market standard" claims. ML1 review required before any of these enter the doctrine base.

1. **BSA agent delegation structure:** Both Pathward/MetaBank agreements (Agreements 2A and 2B) use express BSA agent delegation — the bank formally appoints the program manager as its BSA agent. This is a specific legal mechanism under the Bank Secrecy Act that allocates operational performance to the PM while the bank retains regulatory exposure. Not observed in Bancorp Agreement 1A (less clear delegation structure) or Green Dot Agreement 3A (vertically integrated — no delegation needed).

2. **Consequential damages exclusion with three carve-outs:** Both Pathward agreements use an identical three-carve-out structure (indemnified claims, confidentiality/security breaches, gross negligence/willful misconduct/fraud). This pattern warrants further validation against additional agreements before any inference is drawn.

3. **Durbin Regulatory Event as named termination trigger:** Observed in Agreement 2B (MetaBank/EFS) only. Specific to banks near the $10B threshold. Not generalizable beyond that context — but documents that parties do negotiate bespoke regulatory economics triggers, not just generic "regulatory change" provisions.

4. **Bank suspension right (de-risking short of termination):** Present in both Pathward agreements. Structurally important: the bank retains the right to suspend distribution channels unilaterally on regulatory/reputational/safety grounds, without triggering a full termination event. This is a de-risking mechanism within the ongoing agreement, not a termination trigger.

5. **Green Dot vertical integration:** The Green Dot/Walmart structure is architecturally different from all other agreements found so far — program manager and issuing bank are affiliates on the same side, facing an enterprise retailer. This archetype (vertically integrated PM/bank vs. enterprise merchant) is distinct from the two-sided bank-fintech structure and should be tracked separately.

## CIK Corrections Required in Universe v0.3

| Company | Universe v0.3 CIK | Correct CIK |
|---|---|---|
| The Bancorp, Inc. | 1359190 | 1295401 |
| Toronto-Dominion Bank | 947484 | 947263 |

---

## Research Gaps and Next Steps

1. **Bancorp limitation of liability:** Not disclosed in Agreement 1A. Additional counterparty filings (PaySign/3PEA later filings) may have subsequent amendments with less redaction.
2. **Green Dot limitation of liability:** Not disclosed in Agreement 3A. Revenue sharing formula suggests a high-value relationship — liability cap likely significant.
3. **Green Dot WS-B:** Federal Reserve July 2024 consent order is a high-priority WS-B initiation target. Initiate Workstream B extraction from that enforcement action.
4. **Pathward full 15-dimension extraction:** Agreements 2A and 2B are the highest-quality sponsor-bank-side agreements found to date. Recommend full 15-dimension extraction as next pass.

## Change Log

- 2026-04-28 — Initial 5-dimension extraction completed. Three companies screened; four agreements extracted. Two CIK corrections identified (Bancorp, TD). Green Dot WS-B flag raised (Federal Reserve consent order July 2024). Pathward agreements flagged for full 15-dimension extraction.

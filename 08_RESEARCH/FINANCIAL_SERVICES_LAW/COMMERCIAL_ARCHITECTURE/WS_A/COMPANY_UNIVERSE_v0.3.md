# WS-A/0 — Company Universe v0.3

**Workstream:** WS-A (SEC Disclosure Mining)
**Artifact Type:** WS-A/0 — Company Universe
**Status:** Draft — pending ML1 approval
**Output Label:** Derived from disclosed agreement (SEC)
**Supersedes:** v0.2 (2026-04-25)

## Purpose

This document is the canonical target list for Workstream A research. It defines
which companies are in scope for SEC EDGAR disclosure mining, their filing status,
expected agreement archetypes, and research priority.

The universe is organized into seven categories. Sponsor Banks are an elevated
category: they are not payment fintechs, but they are load-bearing counterparties
in issuer processor, program manager, and sponsor bank agreements. Their SEC
filings disclose these relationships from the bank's perspective. Canadian Major
Banks with US Presence is a new elevated category added in v0.3: these institutions
are relevant as correspondent banking counterparties, cross-border payment rail
providers, and increasingly as fintech program sponsors in Canada-US structures.

## Category 6 — Sponsor Banks / Issuing Banks (Elevated)

Sponsor banks are a distinct research target. Unlike fintech filers who disclose
their bank relationships from the program manager's perspective, sponsor banks
that are SEC-registered disclose these relationships from the bank's perspective.
This provides a different documentary angle on the same commercial structures.

### 6.1 Core U.S. Fintech Sponsor Banks

| Bank | SEC Status | CIK | Priority | Research Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sutton Bank | Not SEC-registered (private Ohio-chartered bank) | — | HIGH (via counterparties) | Partial — disclosed in Marqeta EX-10.21 and Block 10-K body (initial harvest 2026-04-25). | Primary issuing bank for Marqeta programs (Block Cash App Card, Square Debit Card).

| The Bancorp, Inc. | SEC-registered (NASDAQ: TBBK) | 1359190 | HIGH | Not yet initiated. | Primary fintech prepaid/debit sponsor bank (Chime, etc.). 10-K filings disclose program manager relationships from the bank's perspective. Priority 1 in queue. |

(f/k/a Meta Financial Group; operating subsidiary MetaBank) | SEC-registered (NASDAQ: CASH) | 798354 | HIGH | Not yet initiated. | Rebranded from Meta Financial Group in 2022; MetaBank was the operating bank subsidiary. Now trading as Pathward Financial. Major prepaid card sponsor bank and BaaS provider. Long SEC filing history under both names.

| Cross River Bank | Not SEC-registered (private NJ-chartered bank) | — | MEDIUM (via counterparties) | Not yet initiated. | Major fintech sponsor bank (Affirm, Upgrade, Coinbase, others). FDIC consent order (2023) for fair lending — enforcement record relevant to WS-B. Search counterparty SEC filings (Affirm AFRM, Upgrade via any SEC filings) for Cross River relationship disclosures. |
| Evolve Bank & Trust | Not SEC-registered (private Arkansas state bank) | — | HIGH (via counterparties / WS-B) | Not yet initiated. | Major fintech BaaS bank. Federal Reserve consent order (June 2024) for AML/BSA failures — critical WS-B source. Synapse insolvency (2024) involvement provides post-failure architecture visibility. Search Stripe, Mercury, and Synapse-adjacent counterparty filings. WS-B priority target. |

### 6.2 Secondary / Emerging Sponsor Banks

## Category 7 — Canadian Major Banks with US Presence (Elevated — Added v0.3)

These institutions are relevant as (a) correspondent banking counterparties in
MSB-to-bank commercial agreements, (b) cross-border payment rail providers for
Canada-US structures, and (c) increasingly as fintech program sponsors in
Canada-US commercial arrangements. All four file Form 40-F with the SEC as
foreign private issuers, giving access to their Annual Information Forms and
material agreement disclosures.

### 7.1 Core Targets

| Bank | SEC Filing | CIK | US Entity | Priority | Research Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) | Form 40-F (foreign private issuer) | 947484 | TD Bank, N.A. (US chartered bank; largest US retail banking footprint of any Canadian bank) | HIGH | Not yet initiated. | TD Bank, N.A. is a major US retail bank and payment services provider. Fintech partnerships and payment processing relationships likely disclosed in 40-F and US subsidiary SEC filings. TD's US operations include former Commerce Bank and South Financial Group franchises. |
| Bank of Montreal (BMO) | Form 40-F (foreign private issuer) | 927971 | BMO Bank N.A. (formerly Bank of the West; acquired 2023) | HIGH | Not yet initiated. | Significant US retail banking presence post-Bank of the West acquisition. BMO Bank N.A. is an OCC-chartered national bank. Cross-border payment and commercial banking structures likely in 40-F. |
| Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) | Form 40-F (foreign private issuer) | 1000177 | City National Bank (California; acquired 2015); RBC Capital Markets LLC | MEDIUM | Not yet initiated. | City National Bank is RBC's primary US retail banking entity. RBC's US investment banking and capital markets operations may have disclosed commercial payment structures. |
| Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) | Form 40-F (foreign private issuer) | 9631 | Scotia Capital (USA) Inc.; US branch operations | MEDIUM | Not yet initiated. | Smaller US retail footprint vs. TD/BMO. US presence primarily through capital markets and correspondent banking. Cross-border Canada-US payment corridors relevant to MSB clients. |

### 7.2 Research Approach for Canadian Banks

- Primary source: Form 40-F annual filings at SEC EDGAR (these are the Canadian equivalent of a Form 20-F; they incorporate the Canadian Annual Information Form by reference)
- Material agreements: Filed as exhibits under Item 9 of Form 40-F and Exhibit 1 (AIF)
- US subsidiary filings: TD Bank, N.A. and BMO Bank N.A. may file separately as national banks; FDIC call reports and OCC filings are parallel sources
- Relevance filter: Focus on payment services, correspondent banking, fintech partnership, and cross-border payment rail agreements disclosed in these filings

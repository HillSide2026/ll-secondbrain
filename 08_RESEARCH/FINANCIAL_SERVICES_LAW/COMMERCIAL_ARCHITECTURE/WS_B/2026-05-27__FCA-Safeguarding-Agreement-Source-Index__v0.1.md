# FCA Safeguarding Agreement Source Index

## Status

This is a draft source index for researching FCA safeguarding agreement mechanics.
It is not approved doctrine and does not state market standard.

The public sources located are mostly customer-facing terms or safeguarding
disclosures. They are useful for identifying disclosed safeguarding mechanics,
but they are not the private bank or custodian safeguarding account agreement.

The closest FCA-public "agreement" source is the CASS 15 safeguarding account
acknowledgement letter template referenced through FCA PS25/12.

## Research Use

This source index should feed:

- `FCA_CASE_ARCHITECTURE_MAP` artifacts for individual examples;
- a `CONTROL_GAP_LIBRARY` for no set-off, acknowledgement letter, reconciliation,
  insolvency distribution, and account designation mechanics;
- an `IMPLIED_CLAUSE_REQUIREMENTS` artifact translating FCA safeguarding
  expectations into structural drafting requirements.

Do not use these sources to claim market standard without a separate,
source-attributed Workstream A or ML1-approved synthesis.

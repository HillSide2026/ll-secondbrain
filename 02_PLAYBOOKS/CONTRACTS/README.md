# Contracts Practice Area

Solution frames, decision support, and agent infrastructure for contract matters.

---

## Scope

This practice area covers the preparation, review, and assembly of contractual instruments where LL acts for one party. It does not cover:
- Contract disputes beyond demand letter (separate scope)
- Corporate governance instruments (see CORPORATE)
- Real estate agreements (separate scope)

---

## Dispute Boundary

LL may draft and send a demand letter within this practice area. After demand letter, the matter transitions to a separate disputes scope.

---

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [SOLUTIONS/](SOLUTIONS/) | Solution frames for contract types |
| [ISSUE_MAPS/](ISSUE_MAPS/) | Structured taxonomies of contract issues |
| [DECISION_LENSES/](DECISION_LENSES/) | Analytical frameworks for contract decisions |
| [FAILURE_MODES/](FAILURE_MODES/) | Known failure patterns in contract matters |
| [QUESTION_BANKS/](QUESTION_BANKS/) | Structured intake/scoping questions per Solution |
| [REGULATORY_SURFACES/](REGULATORY_SURFACES/) | Statutory/regulatory touchpoints |
| [AGENTS/](AGENTS/) | Agent specifications and supporting references |

---

## Relationship to CORPORATE

These are parallel practice areas with shared architectural patterns but independent content. Cross-practice-area routing (e.g., incorporation + vendor contract for new entity) is TBD.

---

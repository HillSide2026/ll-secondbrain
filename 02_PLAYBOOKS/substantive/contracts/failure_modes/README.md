# Contract Failure Modes

Known failure patterns in contract matters.

---

## Purpose

Document recurring ways contracts fail — not as legal analysis, but as pattern recognition. Failures are categorized by when they occur and how they manifest.

---

## Failure Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Formation failures | Contract never properly formed |
| Scope failures | Scope misalignment between parties |
| Performance failures | Obligations not met or not measurable |
| Amendment failures | Changes not properly documented |
| Termination failures | Exit process mishandled |
| Assignment failures | Transfer without proper consent |
| Enforcement failures | Rights exist but cannot be exercised |

---

## Dispute Boundary

Failure mode documentation stops at demand letter. Post-demand-letter failure patterns belong to a separate disputes scope.

---

## Failure Mode Format

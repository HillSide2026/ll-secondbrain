# Contract Issue Maps

Structured taxonomies of recurring contract issues.

---

## Purpose

Issue Maps decompose contract problem spaces into structured, navigable issue trees. They identify what issues exist, not how to resolve them.

---

## Planned Issue Maps

| ID | Name | Domain |
|----|------|--------|
| IM-TERM-01 | Termination Rights | When and how contracts end |
| IM-LIAB-01 | Liability Allocation | Indemnities, caps, exclusions |
| IM-IP-01 | Intellectual Property | Ownership, licensing, assignment |
| IM-CONF-01 | Confidentiality | Scope, duration, exceptions |
| IM-PAY-01 | Payment & Pricing | Terms, adjustments, disputes |
| IM-PERF-01 | Performance Standards | SLAs, KPIs, remedies |
| IM-ASSIGN-01 | Assignment & Change of Control | Transfer restrictions |
| IM-GOVERN-01 | Governing Law & Dispute Resolution | Jurisdiction, arbitration, mediation |

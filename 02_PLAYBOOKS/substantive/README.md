## Relationship to Solution Frames

This `substantive/` tree is the playbook layer for execution workflows.

Canonical solution frames live under:

- `02_PLAYBOOKS/<PRACTICE_AREA>/SOLUTIONS/`

Substantive playbooks should reference the canonical solution frames rather than duplicate solution-frame artifacts. Any duplicate solution-frame files here are legacy until explicitly retired by ML1.

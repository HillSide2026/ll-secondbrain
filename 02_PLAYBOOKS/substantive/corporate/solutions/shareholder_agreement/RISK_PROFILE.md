# Risk Profile: Shareholder Agreement

---

## Default Risk Posture

Conservative, market-standard private company positioning.

---

## Key Failure Surfaces

| Failure | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Misclassification of SA vs USA | Wrong liability allocation; statutory non-compliance |
| Unintended restriction of directors' statutory powers | Accidental USA creation |
| Failure to communicate shareholder liability consequences | Client unaware of duties assumed |
| Non-unanimous execution of USA | Invalid agreement |

---

## SA-Specific Risks

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Contractual provisions unenforceable against corporation | Board can act contrary to SA |
| Minority shareholders without adequate protection | Oppression exposure |
| Exit provisions without clear valuation | Disputes at triggering event |
| Deadlock without resolution mechanism | Corporate paralysis |

---

## USA-Specific Risks

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Shareholders assume director-level duties unknowingly | Personal liability exposure |
| Incomplete power transfer | Ambiguous authority |
| Certificate notation omitted | Subsequent purchaser not bound |
| Inconsistency with Articles | Validity questions |
| Future shareholders not bound | USA must be re-executed |

---

## Ontario / Federal Pitfalls

| Jurisdiction | Pitfall |
|--------------|---------|
| Both | Treating a USA as merely a stronger SA |
| Both | Inconsistency between USA terms and Articles / resolutions |
| OBCA | Missing certificate notation requirements |
| CBCA | Overlooking federal-specific compliance details |

---

## Non-Obvious Risks

| Risk | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Shareholders unknowingly assuming director-level duties | Personal liability for management decisions |
| Future financings blocked by rigid USA | Investors may require USA termination |
| Deadlock provisions inappropriate for shareholder count | Two-person vs multi-party dynamics differ |
| Exit pricing disconnected from reality | Disputes at worst possible time |

---

## Classification Risk

The most significant risk in this solution is **misclassification**:

- An SA that accidentally restricts directors' powers may be treated as a USA
- A USA that fails statutory requirements may be unenforceable
- The line between "contractual governance" and "power restriction" requires judgment

---

## Escalation Principle

If an agreement shifts or blurs management authority, escalate rather than normalize.

When the SA/USA classification is unclear, this is not a judgment call to make silently.

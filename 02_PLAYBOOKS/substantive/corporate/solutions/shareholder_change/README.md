# Shareholder Change

This solution frame applies to situations where ownership, control, or economic rights among shareholders are changing.

---

## What This Is

A structured mapping of the problem space when shareholder composition or rights shift.

## What This Is Not

- This is not legal advice
- This does not prescribe a specific transaction structure
- This does not replace professional judgment

Final judgment remains with ML1.

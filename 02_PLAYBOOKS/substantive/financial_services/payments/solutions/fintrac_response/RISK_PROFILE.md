# Risk Profile: FINTRAC_RESPONSE

## Inherent Risk Characteristics

- **Deadline-driven** — FINTRAC inquiries typically carry response deadlines
- **Escalation sensitivity** — Examination may escalate to enforcement at any point
- **Information asymmetry** — Client documentation may be incomplete or inconsistent
- **Regulatory exposure** — Findings during response may reveal additional compliance gaps

## Key Risk Dimensions

- Risk of incomplete or inconsistent document production
- Risk of inadvertent disclosure or waiver
- Risk of scope expansion beyond initial inquiry
- Risk of response revealing unregistered or mischaracterized MSB activities

## Risk Management Posture

- Clear documentation of response scope and limitations
- Explicit distinction between advisory response and admissions
- Defined escalation paths if examination shifts to enforcement
- Early identification of matters exceeding solution scope

## Escalation Boundary

Escalation from examination to enforcement triggers a scope boundary. Enforcement-stage work is outside this solution and requires separate engagement authorization.

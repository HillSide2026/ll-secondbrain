# Risk Profile: MSB_INTAKE_AND_REGISTRATION

## Inherent Risk Characteristics

- **Classification risk** — Risk of incorrect or incomplete MSB categorization
- **Information quality risk** — Reliance on client-provided descriptions and documentation
- **Change risk** — Business models may evolve shortly after registration
- **Implementation gap risk** — Policies may not be implemented or operationalized by the client

## Risk Management Posture

- Conservative treatment of ambiguity
- Clear documentation of assumptions and exclusions
- Explicit distinction between policy drafting and implementation
- Early identification of matters exceeding solution scope

## Escalation Sensitivity

Findings may require escalation to:

- MSB_REVIEW (periodic or post-change assessment), or
- FINTRAC_RESPONSE (if regulator engagement is active or imminent)

Escalation is documented but not executed within this solution.

# Risk Profile: MSB_REVIEW

## Inherent Risk Characteristics

The MSB Review solution typically involves:

- **Moderate regulatory risk** — Issues may already exist but are not yet crystallized
- **Change-driven risk** — Risk often arises from business evolution rather than intent
- **Information asymmetry** — Incomplete or outdated internal documentation is common
- **Escalation sensitivity** — Findings may trigger regulator engagement or require strategic decisions

## Key Risk Dimensions

- Risk of uncovered or mischaracterized MSB activities
- Risk of outdated or incomplete registration information
- Risk of AML/KYC framework misalignment
- Risk of scope creep into remediation or defence work

## Risk Management Posture

- Focus on issue identification, not resolution
- Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations
- Explicit distinction between observations and legal conclusions
- Defined escalation paths where regulator interaction is implicated

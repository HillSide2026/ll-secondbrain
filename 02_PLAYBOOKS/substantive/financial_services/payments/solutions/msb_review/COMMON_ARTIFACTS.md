- **Change Log** — Identified changes since last registration or review
- **Issue List** — Discrete legal/compliance issues with prioritization
- **Risk Summary** — High-level regulatory risk characterization

## Optional / Contextual Artifacts

- Follow-up question list
- Clarification requests
- Escalation or referral notes
- Scope-boundary statements (what was not reviewed)

## Notes

All artifacts are advisory and diagnostic in nature.

# MSB Review — Overview

The MSB Review solution provides a structured legal review of an existing money services business's (MSB's) regulatory posture under the PCMLTFA / FINTRAC regime, focused on identifying material gaps, inconsistencies, and risk areas in an MSB's registration status and ongoing compliance framework.

This solution is retrospective and diagnostic, not a full compliance build or regulator-facing response. It is typically engaged where an MSB is already operating, registered (or believes it is registered), and requires confirmation that its current posture remains appropriate.

This solution is internal-facing only.

## Typical Use Cases

- Periodic compliance check-up
- Pre-transaction or investor diligence
- Internal concern about scope drift or business change
- Preparation for potential regulator engagement
- Post-acquisition or post-restructuring review

## Permitted Potential Workstreams

Inclusion of a workstream does not imply automatic execution; all workstreams are optional and engagement-specific.

| Workstream | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| A. STR / LVTR Advisory | Interpretive advice on suspicious transaction reports and large virtual currency transaction reports |
| B. Quarterly Internal Effectiveness Review | Periodic internal-only review of design and structural effectiveness |
| C. Internal Annual Health Check | Holistic annual assessment of accumulated risk signals and compliance posture |

## What This Solution Is Not

- Not a full AML/KYC program design
- Not a regulator examination or enforcement response
- Not an MSB registration filing or amendment submission
- Not ongoing compliance management
- Not a regulator-facing output (see FINTRAC_RESPONSE)

## Operating Posture

Containment over completeness; explicit exit states; no assumed ongoing representation.

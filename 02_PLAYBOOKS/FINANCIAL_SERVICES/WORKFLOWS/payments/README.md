# Financial Services — Payments

Canonical location notice:
Canonical solution packets are maintained under:
`02_PLAYBOOKS/FINANCIAL_SERVICES/SOLUTIONS/[SPECIFIC_SOLUTION]/MODULES/[MODULE_ID]/{WORKFLOWS,TEMPLATES,CHECKLISTS}`.
This payments workflow container does not store canonical solution packets.

Architecture for payments advisory matters. This module defines solution frames, overlays, decision support, and agent infrastructure for the Payments practice area. It contains no legal or compliance analysis and no substantive requirements, thresholds, or procedures.

## Overlays

Overlays are shared modules invoked by solutions. They are not solutions themselves.

| Overlay | Folder |
|---------|--------|
| AML/KYC Program | [overlays/aml_kyc_program/](overlays/aml_kyc_program/) |
| Rails | [overlays/rails/](overlays/rails/) |
| Crypto | [overlays/crypto/](overlays/crypto/) |

---

## Provider Agreements

Drafting and review of provider agreements lives in `02_PLAYBOOKS/CONTRACTS/WORKFLOWS` (not here). This practice area may reference provider agreement terms but does not produce or review them.

## Operating Posture

Containment over completeness; explicit exit states; no assumed ongoing representation.

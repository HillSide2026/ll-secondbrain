# Gap Analysis: Typical Canadian Law Firm Practice

---


The following analysis identifies structural, operational, and quality gaps common in typical Canadian law firm shareholder agreement practice relative to the enterprise standard this service line is designed to achieve.

|GAP AREA|TYPICAL FIRM PRACTICE|THIS SERVICE LINE STANDARD|
|---|---|---|
|Intake & Diagnostic|Unstructured intake; verbal instructions; no formal diagnostic tool|Structured diagnostic questionnaire; scenario classification; cap table intake; articles review before drafting begins|
|Conflict Detection (Articles vs SHA)|Ad hoc comparison; relies on drafter memory; frequently missed in high-volume matters|Mandatory conflict detection protocol (CHK-CON-001); 10 known conflict types; escalation triggers; documented resolution|
|USA / Simple SHA Distinction|Often drafted as simple SHA; USA mechanics added without statutory compliance analysis; share certificate endorsement missed|Threshold determination at intake; USA validity checklist; share certificate legend protocol mandatory; liability reallocation analysis required|
|Director Liability Reallocation (USA)|Rarely disclosed to shareholders; liability analysis absent; no insurance review flag|Liability reallocation memo mandatory for all USAs; insurance review flag; client disclosure protocol|
|Modular Clause Architecture|Template-based drafting with direct edits to full templates; version drift accumulates; no clause coding|Fully modular clause bank; clause codes on all provisions; assembly protocol prevents unauthorized edits to base clauses; version control system|
|Pre-Incorporation Structuring|Often skipped or handled informally; share class design not documented; tax flags not raised systematically|Formal pre-incorporation workflow; share class design decision tree; tax coordination flag triggers; articles integration checklist|
|Cap Table Integration|Cap table not reviewed at SHA drafting; SHA transfer restrictions not reconciled with cap table; NI 45-106 private issuer limit not monitored|Cap table intake mandatory; control logic built into cap table template; NI 45-106 counter; SHA reconciled with cap table at drafting and execution|
|Minority Shareholder Protection|Minority protections ad hoc; oppression remedy considerations not systematically applied; no minority protection matrix|Minority protection matrix; oppression remedy flag at intake; drag/tag provisions systematically reviewed; shotgun clause asymmetry analysis|
|Post-Execution Records Integration|Minute book updates often delayed or incomplete; securities register not consistently updated; USA endorsement frequently missed|Post-execution integration checklist mandatory; immediate minute book and securities register updates; USA endorsement protocol on day-of-execution|
|Ongoing Governance Monitoring|SHA treated as one-off document; no trigger-based review; accession tracking absent; amendment history not maintained|Trigger-based review calendar; accession tracking per entity; amendment log maintained on dashboard; portfolio-level governance risk view|
|Federal / Provincial Differentiation|Often uses single template for CBCA and OBCA corporations without statutory differentiation|Jurisdiction determination at intake; CBCA and OBCA variants for all statutory provisions; USA validity checklist jurisdiction-specific|
|Investor-Grade Provisions|Investor rights added ad hoc without structured clause bank; anti-dilution mechanics inconsistent; SAFE/convertible note reconciliation absent|Dedicated investor-grade clause bank (SHA-I-061 to SHA-I-100); structured upgrade path; SAFE and convertible note reconciliation protocol|
|Quality Assurance|Informal review process; no standardized pre-execution checklist; QA dependent on individual drafter diligence|30-point pre-execution audit checklist; pass/fail gate; senior review required before execution authorization; QA documented in matter file|
|Training & Knowledge Transfer|Apprenticeship model; knowledge held by senior lawyers; no structured training materials; delegation to junior staff risky|Annotated templates; worked scenarios per tier; training module; delegation protocols; system designed for associate/clerk execution under supervision|

## Critical Risk Gaps: Immediate Priority
The following gaps represent the highest legal risk in typical practice and must be addressed as Phase 1 and Phase 2 priorities:
1. USA endorsement on share certificates: frequently missed; creates validity and third-party notice risk under CBCA s. 49(8) and OBCA s. 56(3).
1. Director liability reallocation disclosure: absent in most practice; creates professional liability exposure when shareholders incur liabilities they were not advised of.
1. Articles conflict detection: SHA provisions inconsistent with Articles are unenforceable in key respects; conflict detection must be mandatory before execution.
1. NI 45-106 private issuer compliance: SHA transfer restrictions must be sufficient to maintain private issuer status; failure creates securities law exposure.
1. All-shareholder parties requirement for USAs: a USA signed by fewer than all shareholders is not a valid USA; frequently misunderstood in practice.

# Scenario-Based Drafting Logic Model

---


Each scenario is governed by a defined drafting logic sequence. Drafters follow the sequence precisely. Deviation requires supervisor authorization documented in the matter file.

## Scenario A: Company Already Incorporated - Share Classes Established
|USE CASE|Articles filed; share classes defined; cap table established; client wishes to introduce or retrofit shareholder governance.|
|---|---|

Drafting Logic Sequence:
1. Step 1 – Cap Table Diagnostic: Obtain and verify the current cap table. Confirm authorized, issued, and outstanding shares by class. Identify any options, warrants, or convertible instruments. Flag any discrepancies.
1. Step 2 – Articles Review: Review Articles of Incorporation and any amendments. Extract share class rights, restrictions, and conditions. Confirm any existing restrictions on transfer. Identify any USA notation on share certificates.
1. Step 3 – Conflict Detection: Compare proposed SHA provisions against Articles. Flag conflicts in: transfer restriction mechanics, voting thresholds, share class rights, quorum requirements, and amendment procedures.
1. Step 4 – Harmonization Decision: Where conflicts exist, determine whether to (a) draft SHA to be subordinate to Articles, (b) recommend Articles amendment before SHA execution, or (c) escalate to supervising lawyer for structural advice.
1. Step 5 – Clause Assembly: Assemble SHA from clause bank using Scenario A protocol. Core clauses + Scenario A optional clauses. Flag investor-grade upgrade if any shareholder holds preferred shares or convertible instruments.
1. Step 6 – Risk Flags Review: Run Scenario A risk flag checklist. Escalation triggers: conflict with Articles; minority shareholder holding below 10%; USA execution when director powers not expressly transferred; pre-emptive rights absent when share classes present.
1. Step 7 – QA & Execution: Pre-execution audit. Execution protocol. Minute book and securities register update.

## Scenario B: Company Not Yet Incorporated
|USE CASE|Founders negotiating governance before corporate formation. Share structure not yet designed. Tax planning may be implicated. Articles not yet filed.|
|---|---|

Drafting Logic Sequence:
1. Step 1 – Pre-Incorporation Structuring Workflow: Complete pre-incorporation questionnaire. Identify: number of founders, proposed ownership split, vesting requirements, planned financings, jurisdiction (federal vs provincial), and tax objectives.
1. Step 2 – Share Class Design: Apply share class design decision tree. Standard founder structure: multiple voting common + restricted voting common (or single class for simple structures). Preferred share class for investor participation if anticipated within 24 months.
1. Step 3 – Tax Coordination Flag: Screen for: estate freeze considerations, lifetime capital gains exemption eligibility (small business corporation test), spousal or family trust participation, section 85 rollover potential. If any flag triggered: escalate to tax counsel before articles filed.
1. Step 4 – Founder Allocation Model: Document proposed equity split. Apply vesting logic: minimum 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff standard. Confirm good leaver / bad leaver definitions. Confirm founder buy-back pricing mechanism.
1. Step 5 – Draft Term Sheet + SHA: Produce founder pre-incorporation term sheet. Upon founder agreement, draft SHA and coordinate with articles (ensure share class rights in articles match SHA provisions).
1. Step 6 – Articles Integration Checklist: Confirm SHA provisions are consistent with proposed articles before filing. Articles filed after SHA finalized (subject to any pre-incorporation agreement mechanics).
1. Step 7 – Execution & Records: Execution following incorporation. Update minute book on day-one.

## Scenario C: Simple Shareholder Agreement - No Director Power Transfer
|USE CASE|Closely held company. Standard restrictions and protections. No transfer of director powers to shareholders. Contractual governance only.|
|---|---|

Drafting Logic Sequence:
1. Step 1 – Confirm Scenario: Confirm that no transfer of director powers is contemplated. Confirm all shareholders are parties. Confirm corporate jurisdiction.
1. Step 2 – Core Clause Assembly: Assemble all Core clauses (SHA-C-001 to SHA-C-020) as the contractual backbone.
1. Step 3 – Optional Module Selection: Present optional module selection matrix to supervising lawyer. Standard Scenario C modules: transfer restrictions (ROFR), shotgun clause, drag-along, tag-along, dividend policy, deadlock, dispute resolution. Non-compete and non-solicitation where applicable to shareholder-employees.
1. Step 4 – Governance Allocation Confirmation: Confirm all governance provisions are contractual only. Board retains all statutory powers. SHA governs contractual obligations between shareholders. Note: SHA cannot override director fiduciary duties.
1. Step 5 – Private Issuer Compliance: Confirm transfer restriction language satisfies NI 45-106 private issuer exemption requirements. Confirm 50-shareholder limit is not breached post-closing.
1. Step 6 – QA & Execution: Pre-execution audit checklist. All shareholders sign. Spousal consents where required. Minute book note.

## Scenario D: Unanimous Shareholder Agreement (USA)
|USE CASE|Shareholders agree to transfer some or all director powers to shareholders. Statutory recognition under CBCA s. 146 or OBCA s. 108 required. Enhanced governance control. Director liability implications.|
|---|---|

Drafting Logic Sequence:
1. Step 1 – USA Validity Checklist: Confirm all issued shareholders are parties. Confirm the agreement purports to restrict director powers expressly. Confirm jurisdiction (CBCA or OBCA) and applicable USA recognition provisions.
1. Step 2 – Director Power Reallocation Matrix: Identify which director powers are being transferred to shareholders. Map each transferred power using the governance allocation matrix. Confirm transferred powers are within statutory permissibility (cannot transfer all director powers in a manner inconsistent with corporate law).
1. Step 3 – Liability Reallocation Analysis: Under CBCA s. 146(5) and OBCA s. 108(5), shareholders who hold USA powers assume director liabilities to the extent of those powers. Analyze: employment liability, environmental liability, wage obligations, tax remittances. Produce liability reallocation memo. Flag to client. Insurance review flag if liability significant.
1. Step 4 – Director Indemnity Review: Assess whether director indemnity provisions in the articles or existing governance documents require modification given power reallocation. Produce recommendation.
1. Step 5 – Clause Assembly: Core clauses + USA-specific clauses (USA-S-101 to USA-S-120) + applicable optional modules. Note distinction between contractual SHA provisions and statutory USA mechanics.
1. Step 6 – Share Certificate Endorsement Protocol: Prepare share certificate legend. Under CBCA s. 49(8) and OBCA s. 56(3), notice of USA must appear on share certificates or be provided to holders. Prepare endorsement/legend text for all outstanding share certificates. Flag for re-issuance or endorsement at execution.
1. Step 7 – Third-Party Reliance Notice: Assess whether any third parties (lenders, landlords, material counterparties) need to be notified of the USA and its governance implications. Prepare notice protocol if applicable.
1. Step 8 – QA, Execution & Records: USA-specific pre-execution audit. Execution by all shareholders. Share certificate endorsement. Minute book update. Update corporate records to reflect USA status.

## Cross-Scenario Decision Tree: Agreement Type Selection
The following logic governs agreement type selection at intake. This is the threshold determination before any drafting begins.

|INTAKE QUESTION|ROUTING OUTCOME|
|---|---|
|Is the corporation incorporated?|YES → Scenario A or C/D. NO → Scenario B.|
|Do shareholders wish to transfer any director powers to shareholders?|YES → Scenario D (USA required). NO → Scenario C or A.|
|Are articles already filed with share classes defined?|YES → Scenario A diagnostic protocol applies. NO → Scenario B or C.|
|Is any investor (non-founder) a party to the agreement?|Investor-grade clause bank triggered. Escalation to senior review required.|
|Does any shareholder hold preferred shares or convertible instruments?|Investor-grade optional modules mandatory. Anti-dilution and liquidation preference clauses required.|
|Are all shareholders parties to the proposed agreement?|NO → Cannot be a USA. Must remain a simple SHA. Flag and confirm scope.|

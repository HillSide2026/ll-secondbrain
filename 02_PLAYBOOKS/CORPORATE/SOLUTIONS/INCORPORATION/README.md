# Incorporation

This solution frame applies to formation of a new Ontario or federal (Canada) corporation.

---

## What This Solution Is

- A bounded, repeatable resolution pattern for forming a new corporation
- An execution frame for assembling incorporation artifacts under OBCA or CBCA
- A selection-safe solution callable by a Master Agent

---

## What This Solution Is Not

- Not a tutorial on corporate law
- Not a substitute for legal judgment on structure or tax
- Not suitable for complex, bespoke, or regulated entity formation

---

## Canonical Use Case

> Client requires formation of a standard private corporation with typical share structure and governance assumptions.

---

## Jurisdiction Note

Incorporation may be under either:
- **OBCA** (Ontario Business Corporations Act)
- **CBCA** (Canada Business Corporations Act)

This solution includes an explicit branch for selecting the statute.

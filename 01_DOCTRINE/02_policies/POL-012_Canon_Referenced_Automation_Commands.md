# POL-012 — Canon-Referenced Automation Commands

Policy Statement: Automation command definitions must explicitly list canonical inputs by exact repo path and include governing doctrine references by id/path. Commands may not rely on general instructions alone.
Authority (Principles referenced): PRN-002, PRN-004, PRN-007
Enforcement expectation: Command definitions lacking explicit canon inputs or doctrine references are non-compliant and must be revised before use.
Version: 1.0
Status: Active

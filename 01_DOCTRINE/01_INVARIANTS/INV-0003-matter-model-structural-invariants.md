# Matter Model Structural Invariants (Binding Invariant)

## Invariant
The matter domain model is a structural contract. The following properties must remain true.

## Structural Rules
1. Matter is the economic/control container.
2. Solution is a child monetizable unit of a Matter.
3. Strategy is a child monetizable unit of a Matter.
4. Solution and Strategy are both Service types.
5. Service is an open-ended supertype; Solution and Strategy are required subtypes but do not exhaust all possible service forms.
6. `matter_id` is globally unique and immutable.
7. Every Solution must belong to exactly one valid `matter_id` (no orphan solutions).
8. Every Strategy must belong to exactly one valid `matter_id` (no orphan strategies).
9. A Matter has exactly one top-level `status`, with allowed values: `open`, `pending`, `closed`.
10. A Matter has exactly one `delivery_status`.
11. A Matter has exactly one `fulfillment_status`.
12. Canonical structured fields are source of truth; summaries, dashboards, digests, and action queues are derived views and must not override canonical fields.
13. Derived command-layer outputs may append ML1-action fields and operational-signal overlays, but may not collapse, recode, or substitute for canonical `delivery_status` or `fulfillment_status`.
14. Matter File mappings and external artifacts may enrich or evidence a Matter, but may not redefine `matter_id`, `status`, `delivery_status`, or `fulfillment_status`.
15. **Taxonomy Separation Rule:** `delivery_status` (matter-level) and `service_type` (service-level) are independent classification axes. `delivery_status` must not be used to infer `service_type`. `service_type` must not be used to infer `delivery_status`. A matter with `delivery_status: strategic` may contain services of `service_type: strategy` or `service_type: solution` or both.
16. Every Matter must contain at least one Service.
17. Service streams (also called service workstreams) are sub-units of a specific Service. They are described within the service entry and must not be listed as separate top-level Service entries in MATTER.yaml.

## Boundary
This invariant defines structure and cardinality only. Policy documents define operational status vocabularies, transitions, and thresholds.

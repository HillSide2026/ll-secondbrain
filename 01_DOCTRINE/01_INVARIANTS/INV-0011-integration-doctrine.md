# INV-0011 — Integration Doctrine

**Invariant ID:** INV-0011  
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Authority:** ML1

---

## 1. Purpose

To govern how ML2 interacts with Office 365 and Google Workspace.  
To ensure integrations increase leverage without compromising authority integrity.

---

## 2. Classification of External Platforms

### 2.1 Tier-2 Execution Surfaces

Office 365 and Google Workspace are classified as:
- Tier-2 Execution Surfaces

They are:
- Collaborative environments
- Distribution layers
- Communication tools

They are not:
- Canonical repositories
- Doctrine authorities
- Approval systems

### 2.2 Tier-1 External Systems (Integration Points)

The following systems are classified as Tier-1 External Integration Points:

| System | Purpose | Authority Level | Read Permissions | Write Permissions |
|--------|---------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Gmail** | Email inbox, threading, message retrieval | Tier-1 | Permitted for inbox governance, triage, and message context | Drafts only; no autonomous send |
| **SharePoint** | Matter folder federation, document storage, matter file envelopes | Tier-1 | Permitted for matter file discovery, metadata enumeration, federated folder verification | Write only to designated staging areas and version-controlled artifact placement |
| **Clio** | Practice management, matter metadata, matter_id authority | Tier-1 | Permitted for matter identity verification, matter status retrieval, client-of-record lookup | Write only for matter lifecycle signals (status updates, closed/archived flagging) via gated protocols |
| **Asana** | Task management, project workflow coordination, external task tracking | Tier-1 | Permitted for task status, project progress monitoring, deadline tracking | Write only to designated project/task boards with audit logging |
| **Canva** | Brand asset templates, design templates, marketing collateral | Tier-1 | Permitted for template catalog enumeration, version tracking | Write only to designated template repositories with brand compliance verification |
| **Lexaro** | Practice management under evaluation (potential Clio replacement) — matter, client, task, document metadata | Tier-1 | Permitted for read-only observation of matters, clients, tasks, and document metadata via `/api/external/v1/*` | **Read-only. No writes permitted under any mode.** (Mode 1 only) |

### 2.3 Integration Tiers Defined

**Tier-1 External Systems:** Systems with formal MCP servers and explicit integration control policies. Integrations are governed; authority flow is ML2 → System → External Platform.

**Tier-2 Execution Surfaces:** Systems for collaborative work and distribution. These are not authoritative but may receive published copies of canonical artifacts.

---

## 3. Allowed Integration Actions by System

### 3.1 Office 365 & Google Workspace (Tier-2)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted when:
- Required for QC review
- Required for template population
- Required for drift detection
- Explicitly authorized in integration control policy

#### Write Permissions

Permitted only for:
- Publishing derived artifacts
- Updating approved distributed templates
- Writing structured outputs tied to ML2 version references

All writes must:
- Include version metadata
- Log artifact ID
- Log timestamp
- Log triggering agent

---

### 3.2 Gmail (Tier-1)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted for:
- Inbox triage and message retrieval
- Matter context hydration (message thread retrieval)
- Client communication thread assembly
- Email metadata extraction (sender, recipient, date, subject)

#### Write Permissions

**Prohibited:** Autonomous email send, scheduled send, reply composition, forwarding.

**Permitted:** 
- Draft composition (stored locally, requires ML1 review before send)
- Label application (if governed by inbox governance protocol)
- Email classification signals (extracting context without state mutation)

---

### 3.3 SharePoint (Tier-1)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted for:
- Matter folder structure enumeration
- Matter file metadata retrieval (folder names, item counts, modification dates)
- Federated matter file surface verification
- Document inventory and version tracking

#### Write Permissions

Permitted only for:
- Publishing versioned matter summary artifacts to designated matter folders
- Updating matter-level status overlays (when governed by PRO-020, PRO-021, PRO-022)
- Writing structured metadata files tied to canonical matter records

All writes must:
- Reference canonical matter_id
- Include version metadata and ML2 provenance
- Comply with matter file staging protocol (PRO-020, PRO-021, PRO-022)

---

### 3.4 Clio (Tier-1)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted for:
- Matter identity lookup (matter_id to Clio matter number mapping)
- Client-of-record and matter status retrieval
- Matter metadata synchronization for canonical verification

#### Write Permissions

Permitted only for:
- Matter lifecycle signals (archived/closed status updates when governed by policy)
- Hourly or billing code updates (when explicitly authorized by execution protocol)

All writes must:
- Be gated by explicit protocol (e.g., PRO-016 for fulfillment handoff)
- Include audit timestamp and triggering agent
- Reference the ML2 run that triggered the change

---

### 3.5 Asana (Tier-1)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted for:
- Task status retrieval and deadline tracking
- Project-level progress monitoring
- Task assignment and ownership verification

#### Write Permissions

Permitted only for:
- Task status updates (when governed by project workflow protocol)
- Task creation for project-linked work items (requires explicit gating)
- Subtask or checklist updates (when within allocated project scope)

All writes must:
- Include reference to authoritative project or work artifact in ML2
- Log timestamp, agent, and change summary
- Never autonomously resolve or close project tasks without explicit gate

---

### 3.6 Canva (Tier-1)

#### Read Permissions

Permitted for:
- Template catalog enumeration
- Template version tracking
- Brand asset and color palette verification

#### Write Permissions

**Prohibited:** Direct template mutation in Canva by agents.

**Permitted:**
- Template version registration and metadata logging
- Brand compliance overlay artifacts (stored locally or in designated staging areas)
- Template retirement and deprecation signaling

All template changes are staged locally, verified against brand policy (POL-047, POL-050), and promoted to Canva only via explicit ML1 approval.

---

### 3.7 Lexaro (Tier-1, Read-Only)

- Matter metadata retrieval (name, status, client reference, dates, identifiers)
- Client and contact metadata retrieval
- Task metadata and task state observation
- Document metadata and document index retrieval (metadata only; no content download)

This includes but is not limited to: creating records, updating records, deleting records,
changing matter or task status, uploading documents, writing notes, writing comments,
triggering workflows, marking anything complete, creating calendar events, modifying deadlines,
or sending communications.

No write method may exist in the Lexaro integration layer. The prohibition is enforced in code.

---

## 4. Prohibited Behaviors

- Overwriting canonical ML2 artifacts
- Treating a shared Google Doc as authoritative
- Auto-promoting edited documents to canonical status
- Allowing undocumented edits to alter doctrine

---

## 5. Promotion Requirement

External edits become candidates only. They require:
- Candidate flag
- Diff vs canonical
- ML1 approval
- Version increment
- Republish

No bypass permitted.

---

## 6. Integration Logging

Every integration event must log:
- Source platform
- Target artifact
- Artifact version
- Change summary
- Initiating agent or human
- Approval reference (if applicable)

Logs must be auditable.

---

## 7. Related Policies and Protocols

This invariant is complemented by integration-specific policies and protocols:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| POL-024 | Integration Adapter Gatekeeping |
| POL-035 | Model Context Protocol Governance |
| POL-037 | External System Integration Policy |
| POL-043 | Clio Matter ID Structure and Client of Record Identity |

## 8. Boundary

This invariant establishes the **classification and governance rules** for all external platform integrations.

Policies define operational constraints, approval gates, and use-case-specific permission boundaries.

Protocols define enforcement mechanics, validation checks, and audit logging formats.

# POL-039 — Solution Policy

Status: Draft for ML1 Approval  
Authority Flow: ML1 -> ML2 -> System -> LL  
Maintained by: ML2

## 1. Purpose

Policy Statement: A Solution is the canonical offering boundary for governed operational design and execution.

This policy defines the Solution as a governed architectural unit so the system can consistently represent what offering is being delivered and prevent drift in how offerings are structured.

## 2. Definition

A Solution is a productized offering that defines the business/legal outcome scope.

A solution:
- is approved under doctrine
- is decomposed into one or more modules
- contains reusable operational assets through those modules

## 3. Architectural Position

Canonical hierarchy:

Practice Area  
-> Solution  
-> Module  
-> Workflow

Example:

```text
FINANCIAL_SERVICES/
  SOLUTIONS/
    AML_COMPLIANCE/
      MODULES/
        CLIENT_ONBOARDING/
        ENHANCED_DUE_DILIGENCE/
```

## 4. Required Structure (Stub)

Each solution must include:

```text
SOLUTION_NAME/
  MODULES/
```

Additional required artifacts and schemas are TBD.

## 5. Naming Rules (Stub)

Solution names must:
- use `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`
- represent a clear offering concept
- avoid ambiguous labels

Detailed naming constraints are TBD.

## 6. Governance (Stub)

Solutions exist only within approved practice-area architecture.

Creation, modification, split, or retirement of solutions must follow governed change control with ML1 approval boundaries.

Detailed lifecycle and approval mechanics are TBD.

## 7. Summary

Solution is the canonical unit answering: what offering is being delivered.

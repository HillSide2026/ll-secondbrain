# POL-034 — Fulfillment Lifecycle Definition and Authority Boundary

Policy Statement: Fulfillment is the governed administrative system that begins at Onboarding and ends at Closed. Fulfillment is not legal delivery and must operate within explicit gate, scope, and authority boundaries.

Scope: Fulfillment operates at the **matter level** — one fulfillment lifecycle instance per matter.

Two fulfillment fields exist on every matter. They are independent:
- `fulfillment_stage` — the sequential lifecycle position (defined in this policy)
- `fulfillment_status` — the operational priority state within the current stage (`urgent` / `active` / `keep in view` / `closing`)

Terminology rules:
- `onboarding` is the canonical fulfillment-stage label for the first stage.
- `conversion` is a marketing-stage label and is not a fulfillment stage.
- Onboarding is a shared boundary: marketing ends here; fulfillment begins here.

Canonical fulfillment lifecycle:

| Stage | Description | Matter Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Onboarding | Consult scheduled; engagement letter being prepared | `pending` |
| Opening | Engagement signed; matter setup underway | `open` |
| Maintenance | Necessary administration of matter | `open` |
| Pending Close | Work complete; administrative file closure | `pending` |
| Closed | Terminal | `closed` |

`Closed` requires a `close_reason` value: `completed` / `declined` / `terminated`

Cross-cutting fulfillment functions:
- Accounts (cross-cutting across Onboarding / Opening / Maintenance): money setup, billing controls, collections, trust/retainer controls
- Admin: fulfillment risk-management controls

Gate and status transition rules:
- Gate 1 (Onboarding Entry): consult scheduled and client intent to proceed confirmed; matter status = `pending`.
- Gate 2 (Engagement Signed): authorizes transition from Onboarding to Opening; matter status transitions to `open`.
- Gate 3 (Opening Complete): opening controls complete and internally approved; authorizes transition to Maintenance.
- Gate 4 (Work Complete): substantive work complete; authorizes transition to Pending Close; matter status returns to `pending`.
- Gate 5 (Close Authorized): ML1 explicit approval; matter status transitions to `closed`; `close_reason` must be set.
- No stage skipping is allowed.

Boundary rules:
- Fulfillment governs administrative execution only; it must not perform legal judgment, legal strategy, or substantive delivery decisions.
- Marketing ends at Onboarding per `POL-032` and `POL-033`; fulfillment begins at Onboarding.
- Maintenance outputs do not authorize doctrine changes or gate overrides.
- Closed may occur only after fulfillment closure preconditions are satisfied and explicitly approved under ML1 authority.

Authority rules:
- ML1 is the sole authority for gate advancement, exceptions, and boundary overrides.
- System/agent layers may enforce controls and produce diagnostics but may not self-authorize stage promotion.

Authority (Principles referenced): PRN-020, PRN-021, PRN-027, PRN-028
Enforcement expectation: Any run, artifact, or workflow that misclassifies fulfillment stages, skips gates, or performs out-of-scope legal-delivery actions is non-compliant and must be blocked or escalated to ML1.

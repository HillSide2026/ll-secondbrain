# POL-040 — Workflow Policy

Status: Draft for ML1 Approval  
Authority Flow: ML1 -> ML2 -> System -> LL  
Maintained by: ML2

## 1. Purpose

Policy Statement: A Workflow is the canonical procedural execution unit within a module.

This policy defines workflow boundaries so operational execution remains consistent, inspectable, and doctrine-aligned.

## 2. Definition

A Workflow is a procedural sequence used to execute work inside a module.

A workflow:
- operates within module scope
- consumes governed inputs
- produces defined outputs/artifacts
- may invoke MCP-governed tools when external interaction is required

## 3. Architectural Position

Canonical hierarchy:

Practice Area  
-> Solution  
-> Module  
-> Workflow  
-> MCP (runtime interaction boundary when needed)

## 4. Required Workflow Artifact Set

Each workflow folder must include:
- `README.md`
- `metadata.yaml`
- `steps.yaml`
- `acceptance.md`

Additional required artifacts and schemas are TBD.

## 5. Workflow Boundaries

A workflow is not:
- a solution
- a module
- a policy/protocol artifact

Workflows define execution procedure; they do not create doctrine authority.

## 6. Governance (Stub)

Workflow creation and modification must remain within approved solution/module boundaries and follow governed change control.

Detailed versioning and promotion controls are TBD.

## 7. Summary

Workflow is the canonical unit answering: how module work is executed.

Authority (Principles referenced): PRN-006, PRN-009, PRN-020, PRN-022, PRN-026  
Related policies: POL-020, POL-027, POL-029, POL-038, POL-039  
Enforcement expectation: Execution artifacts outside governed workflow boundaries are non-compliant and must be corrected or escalated.  
Supersedes: None

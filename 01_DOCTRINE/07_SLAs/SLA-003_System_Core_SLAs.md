# SLA-003: System Core SLAs

Defines how the System runtime behaves. These are runtime guarantees, distinct from ML2 integrity (SLA-001) and compliance measurement (SLA-002).

---

## 1. Execution Determinism

Same input + same ML2 state → same output.

Non-deterministic variation must be bounded or flagged. Variation that is neither bounded nor flagged is a runtime failure, not an acceptable output range.

---

## 2. Gate Enforcement

No artifact progresses stages unless:
- Validation checks pass
- Required fields are complete

No bypass paths exist. A gate that can be bypassed is not a gate.

---

## 3. Escalation Fidelity

Ambiguity → escalate to ML1.

The System must not:
- Guess
- Interpolate
- "Best-effort complete"

This mirrors the No Silent Interpretation SLA in SLA-001. The same constraint applies at the runtime layer: when the System cannot determine the correct path, it stops and surfaces — it does not proceed on a plausible path.

---

## 4. State Awareness

Every run must log:
- **Inputs** — what was received
- **Outputs** — what was generated
- **Referenced artifacts** — what doctrine or templates were used

This supports the Traceability SLA (SLA-001). A run with no state log is a compliance failure.

---

## 5. Failure Visibility

Failures must be:
- Explicit
- Logged
- Categorized as one of: **schema** / **doctrine** / **execution**

No silent degradation. A system that fails quietly is more dangerous than one that fails loudly.

# Principles (Level 2)

Definition: Interpretive values that guide policy formation and resolution of ambiguity.
Principles are interpretation tools and decision heuristics when rules do not fully determine an outcome.
Boundary: Do not define enforcement mechanics or procedural steps.

Typical examples:
- Prefer explicit artifacts over conversational memory.
- Prefer inspectable systems over opaque automation.
- Prefer reversible changes over irreversible ones.
- Human authority overrides automated inference.

Naming convention:
- Canonical active principles in this folder should use `PRN-###_Descriptive_Name.md`.
- `README.md` is the only non-`PRN` exception in the active principles layer.

Frontmatter metadata convention:
- Active principle files should carry a dedicated `applies_to` frontmatter field.
- `applies_to` is separate from the flat `tags` list and uses controlled values: `ML2`, `System`, `LL`, `HillSide`.
- More than one `applies_to` value may be selected when a principle spans multiple portfolios.

Repository hygiene rule:
- Legacy family prefixes should not remain in this folder once the principle has been normalized into the active `PRN` sequence.

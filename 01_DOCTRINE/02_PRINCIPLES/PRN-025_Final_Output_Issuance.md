# PRN-025 - Final Output Issuance

Title: Final Output Issuance

Statement:
Only the orchestrating agent for a governed run may issue final outputs. Other agents, workers, and integration adapters may generate intermediate artifacts but may not issue the run's final output.

Rationale:
Single-point final issuance preserves accountability and avoids output-status confusion across execution chains.

Supersedes: None
Version: 1.0
Status: Active

# Principle-to-Policy Cross-Reference

This document maps principles (Level 2) to policies (Level 3), enabling traceability from interpretive values to operational constraints.

Use this index to:
- Understand which policies implement a principle
- Find the principle basis for a policy
- Trace doctrine hierarchy and dependencies

## Notes

- **Many-to-Many Relationship:** Principles often inform multiple policies; policies may implement multiple principles.
- **Hierarchical Enforcement:** Violations of principles flow through policies to protocols for enforcement.
- **Bidirectional Traceability:** Use this index to:
  1. **Forward:** From principle → related policies (answer: "What enforces this value?")
  2. **Backward:** From policy → related principles (answer: "What value justifies this rule?")

- **Missing References:** If a policy exists without a principle basis, it may indicate:
  - An operational/procedural rule (belongs in Protocols, not Policies)
  - A gap in principle coverage (candidate for new principle)

## Updates

- **Created:** 2026-05-04 (initial mapping)
- **Last Updated:** 2026-05-04

To update this cross-reference:
1. When adding a new principle, identify related policies and add rows.
2. When adding a new policy, identify the principle basis and add columns.
3. Mark deprecated mappings with `*Retired*` or `*Reserved*` status.

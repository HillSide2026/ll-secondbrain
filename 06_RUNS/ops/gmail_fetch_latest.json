Les conférencières invitées exploreront des questions critiques à l’intersection des droits des femmes et de la justice - allant de la sauvegarde de la liberté de participer pleinement et se diriger dans tous les domaines de la société, à la résolution des lacunes systémiques qui laissent tomber les survivantes, renforce les préjugés, et ont un impact disproportionné sur les femmes marginalisées.

Join to hear directly from us and stay in touch with the OpenAI developer community.\r\n\r\n⚡ What's new\r\n\r\nWhat shipped, what changed, what to automate next\r\n\r\n*\r\nYour new command center for agentic coding*\r\nThe Codex app is designed for multi-tasking with agents ( https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/ ) and connects to all your tools. Supervise parallel workstreams, review changes cleanly, and stay in control from background execution to shipped code. And for a limited time, try Codex ( https://openai.com/codex/ ) in ChatGPT Free and ChatGPT Go.\r\n\r\n*Make Codex smarter everywhere\r\n* GPT-5.3-Codex can make Codex a more autonomous coworker ( https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/ ) across all Codex surfaces: the app, CLI, IDE extensions, and web—and is now available in the Responses API, too. We also released a research preview of GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a smaller, faster model built for real-time coding. ( https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/ )\r\n\r\n*Speed up tool-heavy agent runs with WebSockets\r\n* WebSockets in the Responses API speed up agent runs by 20–40% ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/websocket-mode ) by maintaining a persistent connection—so you only send new inputs instead of full context each turn.\r\n\r\n*Build longer-running agents with the API\r\n* We’ve added an OpenAI-hosted container (with networking), Skills, and automatic compaction to the Responses API. This enables long-running workflows ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-shell ) on computers that execute tasks more reliably ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-skills ) and work across millions of tokens ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/compaction ).\r\n\r\n*Upgrade your Realtime voice stack*\r\nIf you’re building voice agents, gpt-realtime-1.5 is the new default ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/realtime/ ) stronger multilingual conversation, tighter instruction following, and more reliable tool calling.\r\n\r\n*Generate images in bulk with the Batch API\r\n* You can now use the Batch API with our gpt-image models to send async groups of requests at 50% lower cost ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/batch ) , with access to a separate pool of higher rate limits. This is available for our gpt-image models ( https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/image-generation ) : gpt-image-1.5, chatgpt-image-latest, gpt-image-1, and gpt-image-1-mini.\r\n\r\n🧰 Build kit\r\n\r\nGuides, blogs, and things worth cloning\r\n\r\n*Automate the repetitive stuff:* Andrew from the Codex engineering team shows how he uses Codex Automations to offload recurring tasks ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHnlzAPD9QI ) —what to automate, how to set it up, and where it saves real time.\r\n\r\n*Work on two things at once (without chaos):* Joey from the Codex engineering team demos parallel development with Codex worktrees: delegate a feature in one worktree, keep coding in another, then review and land both PRs. Parallel workflows turn waiting time into progress. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ohXlkbXiM4 )\r\n\r\n*Build agents that can run for hours:* Shell tool, Skills, and automatic Compaction are the core primitives for long-running agents. Get our tips for practical patterns ( https://developers.openai.com/blog/skills-shell-tips ) to execute commands, reuse behaviors, and keep context stable over time.\r\n\r\n*Build agents that behave (and remember):* Two Cookbook articles break down how prompt structure shapes agent behavior and reliability ( https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/prompt_personalities ) and how context engineering determines what gets retained vs. dropped ( https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/agents_sdk/context_personalization ).\r\n\r\n*Did your agent improve... or just change?:* Evals turn “feels better” into actual checks. ( https://developers.openai.com/blog/eval-skills ) Did the skill trigger, do the right thing, and leave things clean? This will help you catch regressions early.\r\n\r\n*Stop recomputing the same prompts:* Prompt caching reuses shared prefixes ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tECAkJAI_Vk ) to make AI apps faster and cheaper at scale.\r\n\r\n🛠️ Devs in the wild\r\n\r\nFrom side projects to professional work\r\n\r\n*Company spotlight: Skyscanner*\r\n\r\nBy wiring the Codex CLI into JetBrains ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XkVsE9-ZK4 ) IDEs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Skyscanner gave Codex access to real IDE context ( https://developers.openai.com/blog/skyscanner-codex-jetbrains-mcp ). This unlocks smarter problem-solving, faster feedback loops, and measurable gains in development speed.\r\n\r\n*Developer spotlight: Agrim Singh*\r\n\r\nCheck out the full thread on X from Agrim ( https://x.com/agrimsingh/status/2022028612770443385 ) , CTO of Niyam AI (and Codex ambassador!) for an early wl1 demo, the repo, and notes on the build.\r\n\r\n📣 Insider scoop\r\n\r\nGo behind the scenes with OpenAI engineers\r\n\r\n*Harness engineering ( https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/ ) : leveraging Codex in an agent-first world*\r\n\r\nNote from the author: “Our team has varied experience, and humans can’t fully mind-meld. Codex can: when we encode ‘what good looks like’ in the repo, every run applies it consistently—and the gains compound.”\r\n\r\n- Ryan Lopopolo, Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. Keep up with his work on X ( https://x.com/_lopopolo ).\r\n\r\n*Inside the Postgres Setup ( https://openai.com/index/scaling-postgresql/ ) Powering 800M ChatGPT Users*\r\n\r\nNote from the author: “Before OpenAI, I learned the hard way that startups often over-engineer. Here, I’ve been impressed by how far a deliberately simple setup—a single PostgreSQL writer—can scale with the right optimizations and discipline. That inspired me to share what I’ve seen.”\r\n\r\n- Bohan Zhang, Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. K eep up with his work on X ( https://x.com/BohanZhangOT ).\r\n\r\n*What Actually Happens Inside an AI Coding Agent ( https://openai.com/index/unrolling-the-codex-agent-loop/ ) (We Unrolled It)*\r\n\r\nNote from the author: “Despite being on Codex CLI since the beginning, I learned a lot from putting this post together, so hopefully you will, too!”\r\n\r\n- Michael Bolin, Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI. Follow more of his journey on Threads ( https://www.threads.com/@bolinfest/post/DT3cVLlkubK ).\r\n\r\nHappy building and vibing,\r\n\r\nThe OpenAI Team\r\n\r\n1455 3rd Street\r\nSan Francisco CA 94158\r\nUnsubscribe ( http://url3243.email.openai.com/asm/unsubscribe/?user_id=54382401&data=EE5mOq5KIoQ5FBsPu4NP_BTBh17xCMtaPaZCehHruIJoMDAwdTAwMPHWv8Zpj_liD-qfk214gNHjGW7WFlgGTh-ncpqV1JNb74A45-IFbfrhoBldQq6JqPUDLsJCps6gyGV9mOlqhzka12Pso8XQKSb04B5XghMT1zUjCJrrPicivHc7IXSs2JUqlzqyZL3H0pALH2TMefRCVQKJAe6RAKLvVvLDFXyKzwDRzHNcnQ0UBFEyZasB3MmstYrpgDPhOViri7G8VGXxgTLrC2tX8O9jS0bLLWMwCjQIqEs7_-0Q852h9bXcfzuaO889Gv1Vga0-wfcpy-fsw6-2YBV7YyNNlRfSd4_XOGxwXykcznTQ8Tdt9-6zBLh7zhIdrE5xyxv625b6KzkOf-MZ7DhJMfSSQtPyRzK0TJ135kCvYEz9ZAH9iXYAUK8856uC0gIncNznMwZ9VeOJ5Hm4EQugzpWhl0GALwWPGseEdRv8XtM4y9g6nKoGZh6KvXAskhNIhB1wg9vuT3VVZsoDKNgC6PCP7XZbj5ho )\r\nPrivacy ( https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/ )\r\n\r\nOpenAI © 2015–2026",

Directors' Register*\r\n*2. Officers' Register*\r\n*3. Shareholders' Register* (I believe this is the same thing as a Members'\r\nRegister) why 'Members' Register'' - what is the statutory reference\r\nI have doubled checked this, you are right I don't think there is members\r\nregister required for business corporations, I think it is only for not for\r\nprofit corporations that need to have it.\r\n\r\n*4. Shareholders' Ledger*\r\nWith respect to the Shareholders' Ledger, which I understand to be the same\r\nthing as a transfer register, there are a few things I wanted to note.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure this is correct. i will double check but my practice has been\r\nthat each Shareholder has a ledger showing. I do see that that a combined\r\nledger has its advantages. What does the Act say?\r\n\r\ns. 50 Securities records\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   50 (1) A corporation shall maintain a securities register in which it\r\n   records the securities issued by it in registered form, showing with\r\n   respect to each class or series of securities\r\n   -\r\n\r\n      (a) the names, alphabetically arranged, and the latest known address\r\n      of each person who is or has been a security holder;\r\n      -\r\n\r\n      (b) the number of securities held by each security holder; and\r\n      -\r\n\r\n      (c) the date and particulars of the issue and transfer of each\r\n      security.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this would be the relevant provision but I am not 100% sure. But\r\nit seems as though CBCA doesn't specify whether it is for each individual\r\nSH or one combined one. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Director's Confirmation Resolutions document states there are\r\n10,000,000 outstanding and issued shares, however, when I added up all of\r\nthe current shareholders' shares, the total was 9,674,000. Argh\r\n\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether there were shares that were cancelled or why the\r\nnumber is less than the 10,000,000.\r\n\r\ni am also wondering.\r\n  I think we need this information so the ledger can accurately reflect the\r\ntransactions that occurred.\r\n\r\nabsolutely agreed\r\n Additionally, I noted this directly in the document, but I believe the\r\nfirst shares issued went to REIN Group of Companies Inc. and REIN\r\nsubsequently transferred shares to the rest of the shareholders. Finally,\r\nwe require some additional information to complete the ledger such as share\r\ncertificate numbers and consideration paid for shares.\r\n\r\ni belive directors can also qualify as ISCs. the UBO of REIN Group of\r\nCompanies is Richard Dolan\r\nOkay, thank you. I will update accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this information, I think the ledger will give a clearer picture of\r\neverything that occurred.\r\n\r\nI also was not entirely sure whether each shareholder required an\r\nindividual ledger or if it was better to include all transactions in one\r\nledger, as I have done. Please let me know if you would like me to complete\r\none per shareholder, I am happy to do so.\r\n\r\nThe CBCA requires the following register, but I did not think it was\r\nrelevant in our case:\r\n\r\n*1. Debt Obligations Register*\r\n\r\nIs this correct. what is the exact CBCA provision?\r\nI'm not entirely sure for this one I looked at the CBCA s. 50(1) but I\r\ndon't think it is the same as the debt obligations register and from this\r\nwebsite it says this but same as above I think it actually is for not-for\r\nprofit corporations.\r\n\r\nhttps://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/corporations-canada/en/not-profit-corporations/corporate-records-and-filing-obligations\r\n:\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. if any debt obligations are issued by the corporation, a debt\r\n   obligations register showing: the name and residential or business address\r\n   of each debt obligation holder; an email address, if the debt obligation\r\n   holder has consented to receiving information or documents electronically;\r\n   the date on which each person named in the register became a debt\r\n   obligation holder; the date on which each person named in the register\r\n   ceased to be a debt obligation holder; and the principal amount of each of\r\n   the outstanding debt obligations of each debt obligation holder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the individuals with significant control, and assuming that\r\nthe corporation has 10,000,000 issued and outstanding shares, to be an ISC\r\nyou would need to have 2,500,000 or more shares. Given that, the ISC would\r\nonly be applicable to REIN Group Companies Inc., but my understanding is\r\nthat you cannot list a corporation as an ISC; the individuals who control\r\nREIN would have to be listed instead. As such, I think we need to know who\r\ncontrols that corporation and by extension, who controls Legacy in order to\r\ncomplete the ISC register. Let me know your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Matthew AJ* *Levine*\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and\r\nis only to be used by the intended recipient.

      "body": "Hi Laura\r\n\r\nLet's discus but i'm also just now feeding back\r\n\r\nAs discussed, please find attached the following corporate records prepared\r\nfor your review:\r\n\r\n*1. Directors' Register*\r\n*2. Officers' Register*\r\n*3. Shareholders' Register* (I believe this is the same thing as a Members'\r\nRegister) why 'Members' Register'' - what is the statutory reference\r\n*4. Shareholders' Ledger*\r\nWith respect to the Shareholders' Ledger, which I understand to be the same\r\nthing as a transfer register, there are a few things I wanted to note.\r\n\r\ni'm not sure this is correct. i will double check but my practice has been\r\nthat each Shareholder has a ledger showing. I do see that that a combined\r\nledger has its advantages. What does the Act say?\r\n\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Director's Confirmation Resolutions document states there are\r\n10,000,000 outstanding and issued shares, however, when I added up all of\r\nthe current shareholders' shares, the total was 9,674,000. Argh\r\n\r\n\r\nI am wondering whether there were shares that were cancelled or why the\r\nnumber is less than the 10,000,000.\r\n\r\ni am also wondering.\r\n  I think we need this information so the ledger can accurately reflect the\r\ntransactions that occurred.\r\n\r\nabsolutely agreed\r\n Additionally, I noted this directly in the document, but I believe the\r\nfirst shares issued went to REIN Group of Companies Inc. and REIN\r\nsubsequently transferred shares to the rest of the shareholders. Finally,\r\nwe require some additional information to complete the ledger such as share\r\ncertificate numbers and consideration paid for shares.\r\n\r\ni belive directors can also qualify as ISCs. the UBO of REIN Group of\r\nCompanies is Richard Dolan\r\n\r\nWith this information, I think the ledger will give a clearer picture of\r\neverything that occurred.\r\n\r\nI also was not entirely sure whether each shareholder required an\r\nindividual ledger or if it was better to include all transactions in one\r\nledger, as I have done. Please let me know if you would like me to complete\r\none per shareholder, I am happy to do so.\r\n\r\nThe CBCA requires the following register, but I did not think it was\r\nrelevant in our case:\r\n\r\n*1. Debt Obligations Register*\r\n\r\nIs this correct. what is the exact CBCA provision?\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the individuals with significant control, and assuming that\r\nthe corporation has 10,000,000 issued and outstanding shares, to be an ISC\r\nyou would need to have 2,500,000 or more shares. Given that, the ISC would\r\nonly be applicable to REIN Group Companies Inc., but my understanding is\r\nthat you cannot list a corporation as an ISC; the individuals who control\r\nREIN would have to be listed instead. As such, I think we need to know who\r\ncontrols that corporation and by extension, who controls Legacy in order to\r\ncomplete the ISC register. Let me know your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Matthew AJ* *Levine*\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and\r\nis only to be used by the intended recipient.

A key focus of the conversation was the classification  \r\nof operating funds that individual shareholders, including minority  \r\nshareholder Ruo, contributed out of pocket after the initial investment,  \r\nwhich Matthew Levine confirmed are generally treated as loans and are  \r\nrepaid first during winding-up before the remaining assets are divided  \r\naccording to shareholding. Ruo also raised concerns about potential  \r\nself-dealing if a majority shareholder unilaterally funded the business as  \r\na loan, and they concluded by requesting Matthew Levine's fee structure for  \r\npotential legal services related to the dissolution process.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested next steps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Levine will send Ruo an email with a rough breakdown of the hourly  \r\nrate and charge for a larger scope of services, and a sense of who they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting records Document Notes by Gemini\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Next Steps section in this email helpful?\r\nNot Useful Email Useful Email\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle LLC, 1600 Ampitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA\r\n\r\nYou have received this email because meeting artifacts were initiated in  \r\nGoogle Meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But energy isn't just about physical stamina—it’s deeply tied to emotions, focus, and self-communication.\r\n\r\nThink about a time when you felt unstoppable…\r\n\r\nA time when ideas flowed easily, and you had the drive to take on anything. That state isn’t rare. It can be a daily experience.\r\n\r\n💡 The Triad is your key to unlocking peak potential.\r\n\r\nBy using these three fundamental forces, you can create a powerful internal system that fuels you through any challenge. ⬇️\r\n\r\n📝 The Triad: Your Blueprint for Peak Energy\r\n\r\nTony teaches that energy is both physical and emotional. Your feelings directly shape energy levels, and emotions are influenced by three interconnected forces.\r\n\r\n🔥 Physiology: How you use your body\r\n\r\n🎯 Focus: Where you direct your attention\r\n\r\n🗣 Language: How you communicate with yourself\r\n\r\nMastering the forces of the Triad creates a powerful foundation that sustains momentum.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you’ll build a lasting framework for energy, clarity, and resilience.\r\n\r\n⚓ Mastering Your Triad: The Energy Formula\r\n\r\n💪 1. Physiology: Reset Your Body\r\n\r\nYour physical state affects mental and emotional well-being.\r\n\r\nSomething as simple as a posture shift—standing tall, shoulders back, deep breathing—can create an energy boost.\r\n\r\nTry these proven strategies to elevate your physiology daily. 👇\r\n\r\n- Prioritize sleep: Reduce screen time before bed, dim the lights, and allow the body to rest deeply.\r\n\r\n- Build strength: Tony’s trainer, Billy Beck, recommends squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks. Just 10 minutes daily strengthens the body and keeps you vibrant.\r\n\r\n- Fuel wisely: Nutrient-dense foods (fruits, veggies, beans, lean proteins) may reduce disease risk. Swap one processed item for a whole food and notice the difference.\r\n\r\nSmall, consistent shifts in how you move, rest, and nourish your body create a foundation for lasting energy and vitality.\r\n\r\n👀 2. Focus: Direct Your Attention\r\n\r\nWhere focus goes, energy flows.\r\n\r\nYour attention determines your energy. Dwelling on problems drains you while focusing on possibilities fuels momentum.\r\n\r\n- Morning reset: Start the day with Tony’s priming exercise (https://go.tonyrobbins.com/e3t/Ctc/OT+113/d4K3xc04/MXdWwmdFGdMW6P1CfR8txcD-W1m0cDV5KZFtbN2nfYxK3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3lLW7KNC8X1cHSsQW8VPd0P5y1H2cW7vX6ZS8-NZzkW75q68D5P7gJLW8sg42858MpfvW4Dvx4h49ztzhW5fTrvK8H9t1DVHqSJV7cg7-8W8Wcnks6xMtXkW2sfv6y4-FbYPW83pmkw9f-0QHW1S4tXC5h7_7CW96rf713-m7hRW1_61cs7rFw08W1prdbk2z1ltLW5_dWGC75W-zxW2-gzM94WXymnW1KCMsg3cwcMyW1pldXt6RxwhYW2T5K8X1l4CLFW42YFTX25ywZgW6jTyHK1_TsGzW2vSt6P5pXM65W2-v4GW92YWLHf7F_ZRn04 ) —a mix of breathing, gratitude, and visualization that sets the tone for success.\r\n\r\n- Intentional breaks: Short mental resets throughout the day improve clarity. Even two minutes of deep breathing can restore focus.\r\n\r\n- Power questions: Replace \"Why am I so tired?\" with \"How can I boost my energy in this moment?\" The quality of your experience is a direct reflection of the questions you ask yourself.\r\n\r\nBy consciously directing your focus, you can shift your energy, enhance clarity, and create a more empowered state throughout the day.\r\n\r\n💬 3. Language: Transform Your Communication\r\n\r\nWords create reality, internally and externally.\r\n\r\nSaying “I’m drained” reinforces fatigue. Saying “I’m recharging” encourages renewal.\r\n\r\n- Notice patterns: Catch phrases that drain energy (\"I can't.\" \"I'm overwhelmed.\" \"This is impossible.\") and shift them.\r\n\r\n- Interrupt & replace: When negative language appears, move physically and swap it for an empowering alternative.\r\n\r\n- Elevate your self-talk: Speak to yourself as you would a close friend. Use encouraging, solution-focused language to reinforce confidence and energy.\r\n\r\nThe words you choose shape your emotions and energy. By shifting your language to be more empowering, you can create a more resilient and energized state.\r\n\r\n💥 Your Challenge This Week: Create Your Triad Practice\r\n\r\n📩 Take these three steps to create momentum:\r\n\r\n- Physiology: Choose one habit to reinforce—better posture, deep breathing, hydration, or movement.\r\n\r\n- Focus: Prioritize mental resets during the day, redirecting attention to something energizing.\r\n\r\n- Language: Replace three energy-draining phrases with empowering alternatives.\r\n\r\nThese small shifts strengthen your energy system, allowing you to move toward your most important goals.\r\n\r\nWhen you align your Triad—physiology, focus, and language—every aspect of well-being expands, fueling your energy, relationships, and fulfillment.\r\n\r\n📲 Want to see these principles come to life?\r\n\r\nThe UNLEASHED documentary captures Tony Robbins working with a live audience through some of the most powerful breakthroughs you'll ever witness.\r\n\r\nWatch Unleashed Free\r\n(https://go.tonyrobbins.com/e3t/Ctc/OT+113/d4K3xc04/MXdWwmdFGdMW6P1CfR8txcD-W1m0cDV5KZFtbN2nfYxK3prCCW7lCdLW6lZ3kvN56rVQKRl0JTN74zYXbdrzzzF5ynRXS_gp2W2bs6ct1Bd8cVN2h01KZqkwhwW22T3d24yy1_cW1ZJW0K2lbmM4N68js29WPJhDW3qHP043j83LzW5DmMMF17zc23W22DdRp1rnTPyV6GzpR1mHjtlN3L0j2Jhz505W6BFmCt2SqZ5jN3sSFXqt01w0W2bbPQw5NxBpYW2Nv9kM5YlCxQW3PGSGv5qxrktW70BbF75FhQGhW899p_L24kd14W43MpGR7TzP9xW1RC_bF6VTkf_W3259fZ7_-0-bN3765Tdbxb0Jf3-xNJT04 )\r\n\r\n➡️ What's Coming Next\r\n\r\n📩 Stay tuned for more...\r\n\r\n🧠 Did you know you're making three powerful decisions right now without realizing it?

Координатор уточняет только то, что влияет на безопасность: принимаемые лекарства и дозы, аллергии, эпизоды судорог/психозов, исходные значения давления и пульса, а также бытовые условия — можно ли обеспечить «тихое окно» на 2–3 часа, есть ли свободная розетка и место для полулёжа. Врач приезжает с портативным мониторингом, расходными материалами и резервным планом на случай повышенной реактивности. \r\nИсследовать вопрос подробнее - <a href=\"https://vyvod-iz-zapoya-v-ekaterinburge16.ru/\" / rel=\"nofollow ugc\">вывод из запоя вызов</a>\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15408#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15408#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15408#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,407 comments are waiting for approval.

Зависимость практически никогда не ограничивается только алкоголем или наркотиком: страдают сердце и сосуды, печень, нервная система, психика, отношения в семье и на работе. Если пытаться лечить только одно звено, например, периодически «чистить кровь» капельницами, без проработки причин и последствий, ситуация быстро возвращается к исходной точке. В клинике выстраивается последовательная работа: сначала стабилизируют организм, затем укрепляют психику, а дальше помогают менять привычный образ жизни, чтобы трезвость стала не кратким эпизодом, а новой нормой. \r\nПодробнее тут - http://narkologicheskaya-klinika-chekhov11.ru/\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15392#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15392#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15392#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,391 comments are waiting for approval.

      "body": "Hi Matthew,\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing. Well it's a learning curve for me. I have read both\r\nagreements.\r\nSo Stream Money cannot onboard, Equals can and SM is purely acting as an\r\nintroducer to EM. Initially I thought we didn't need an EPA after finishing\r\nthe document read (this is my first time so I did some digging). In my\r\nview, the EM client agreement should govern every element. However from a\r\nlegal/ commercial perspective it seems that even if Equal Money onboards SM\r\nclients, the SM client is still considered to be interacting with Stream\r\nMoney commercially. I see two different aspects used here: a) from a\r\nregulatory lens, and b) from a legal/commercial lens. Keen to understand:\r\nif something goes wrong with the onboarding or funds who is liable?\r\nI think a client-facing agreement may be required considering that SM is\r\nbranding the service, commercially involved , invoicing clients directly,\r\nproviding the front-end tech platform, and intends to have contractual\r\ncontrol over the introduced clients. It is important to understand that\r\neven if Equals is the regulated entity, clients might perceive they are\r\nusing Stream's platform as a Stream client.

Security Deposit Amount\r\n\r\nI put in the draft that the buyer will compensate you for the value of the security deposit. Please try to confirm the amount so we know whether it is worth negotiating over.\r\n\r\n3. PPSA / Encumbrance Check\r\n\r\nPlease ask your bank to confirm whether there are any outstanding security interests or charges against the equipment or other assets.\r\n\r\nOnce we have clarity on the above, we can pull together the closing agenda.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions / comments or would like to review anything by phone before we send out the redline\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I have your name from Pascal Thibeault, who was a classmate at UofT. I'm also copying our classmate Ron Basu who is running an IP firm in Calcutta.\r\n\r\nMy specific reason for getting in touch is that I am looking for a patent lawyer who is able to work on product development matters. The matter at hand pertains to construction equipment (helical piles). My client already manufactures and sells. He wants to explore a new product but is concerned that there may be a US patent.\r\n\r\nIs this type of file generally in scope for your firm? would you have some time to discuss briefly later in the week? (happy to send conflict info.)\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

These changes include adding clearer steps for resolving matters informally before starting a formal dispute resolution process, updating the opt-out option for the dispute resolution provision, selecting Arizona and US Federal law to apply to any disputes, and, for customers in the US, revisions to the rules and procedures for any arbitration.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n In addition, we've made small changes to help simplify and clarify some provisions. Further updates have also been made for customers in Germany to help ensure alignment with other markets. We encourage you to review the UTOS in full, as additional changes may have been made since you last reviewed them to reflect updates to our products, processes, and operations.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen will the updates take effect?\r\n\r\n\r\n For all new customers, these changes are effective immediately. As an existing customer, the updated UTOS and Refund Policy will take effect on 3/25/2026. This will be the case even if you make a new purchase or sign in to your account. If you have any questions about these updates, \r\nhttps://click.godaddy.com/email/none/?linktype=tes.basecartsite&redir=help%2fa-42823&currencyId=USD&isc=sf6105&marketId=en-US&utm_source=gdsfmc&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=en-US_Multi_Email-nonrevenue_base_gd&utm_content=260223_9094_Manage_Other_Account_Account-Notification_sf6105_B4-Copy-helpa42823-182221-bb4e2c01-3fb0-4b59-ad32-9c3251fac844 \r\nplease visit these Frequently Asked Questions .\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n We appreciate your continued trust in GoDaddy and we look forward to continuing to serve you.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Please do not reply to this email.

I want to explain, the text is below with the change in red.\r\n\r\n\r\nto the extent assignable, the full benefit of all service agreements (the “Service Agreements”) to which the Vendor is a party in connection with the Business;\r\n\r\nThis refers to the Service Agreement that you and your business entered into as part of operating the store / business. It provides that you assign your interest in those contracts to the Purchaser. The word \"assign\" is a lawyer's way of saying that although the written contract will continue to have your name on it, all of the rights and interests will be transferred to the Purchaser.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm receipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

I've also summarized the review. Both are attached\r\n\r\nWe can send the redline to the lawyer on the other side. But, I just want to flag the overlapping to do list.\r\n\r\n1. Subway Transfer Package\r\n\r\nThis is the most important outstanding item. You will want to review Subway’s franchise transfer documentation, including:\r\n\r\n  *   The franchise termination or assignment agreement;\r\n\r\n  *   Any release of your obligations and personal guarantees; and\r\n\r\n  *   The sublease assignment and guarantor release language.\r\n\r\nWe should not finalize the APA without confirming how Subway is structuring the transfer and whether full written releases will be provided.\r\n\r\n2. Security Deposit Amount\r\n\r\nI put in the draft that the buyer will compensate you for the value of the security deposit. Please try to confirm the amount so we know whether it is worth negotiating over.\r\n\r\n3. PPSA / Encumbrance Check\r\n\r\nPlease ask your bank to confirm whether there are any outstanding security interests or charges against the equipment or other assets.\r\n\r\nOnce we have clarity on the above, we can pull together the closing agenda.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions / comments or would like to review anything by phone before we send out the redline\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew AJ Levine\r\n\r\nBarrister & Solicitor\r\n\r\n\r\n1235 Bay Street, Suite 700, TORONTO, M5R 3K4\r\n\r\nT: +1 (647) 598-2598\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message may contain confidential and / or privileged information and is only to be used by the intended recipient.

Специалист помогает человеку увидеть реальную цену алкоголя в его жизни, понять, как именно употребление разрушает здоровье, семью, карьеру, и сформировать установку на трезвость на определённый срок. Используются техники внушения в состоянии расслабления и структурированная работа с убеждениями и привычками. Такой подход особенно полезен тем, кто боится «лекарственного вмешательства» или уже имеет негативный опыт неудачных медикаментозных попыток. В практике лечения в Чехове часто используются комбинированные схемы, когда медикаментозный барьер подкрепляется психотерапевтической поддержкой, а результат кодирования закрепляется за счёт изменения образа жизни и участия в реабилитационных программах. \r\nРазобраться лучше - <a href=\"https://kodirovanie-ot-alkogolizma-chekhov11.ru/\" / rel=\"nofollow ugc\">kak-rabotaet-kodirovanie-ot-alkogolizma</a>\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15343#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15343#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15343#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,342 comments are waiting for approval.

До этого момента обычно проходят годы: чередуются запои и трезвые периоды, звучат обещания «больше такого не будет», меняются напитки, придумываются правила вроде «пью только по выходным» или «только пиво». Но рано или поздно семья замечает, что именно алкоголь диктует распорядок дня, влияет на настроение, разрушает здоровье и отношения. В этот момент становится очевидно: без сильного внешнего ограничителя и профессиональной помощи просто «взять себя в руки» уже не получается. \r\nУглубиться в тему - http://kodirovanie-ot-alkogolizma-chekhov11.ru\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15341#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15341#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15341#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,340 comments are waiting for approval.

До этого момента обычно проходят годы: чередуются запои и трезвые периоды, звучат обещания «больше такого не будет», меняются напитки, придумываются правила вроде «пью только по выходным» или «только пиво». Но рано или поздно семья замечает, что именно алкоголь диктует распорядок дня, влияет на настроение, разрушает здоровье и отношения. В этот момент становится очевидно: без сильного внешнего ограничителя и профессиональной помощи просто «взять себя в руки» уже не получается. \r\nОзнакомиться с деталями - <a href=\"https://kodirovanie-ot-alkogolizma-chekhov11.ru/\" / rel=\"nofollow ugc\">кодирование от алкоголизма в Чехове</a>\r\n\r\nApprove it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&c=15339#wpbody-content\r\nTrash it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&c=15339#wpbody-content\r\nSpam it: https://barberismo.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&c=15339#wpbody-content\r\nCurrently 15,338 comments are waiting for approval.

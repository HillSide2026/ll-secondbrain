# Distill Queue

Rule: Every run ends in exactly one outcome.

Outcomes:
1. Promote
2. Park
3. Archive

When outcome is PARK, create a stub in this folder named:
- `YYYY-MM-DD__<run_id>__<short_slug>.md`

Stub contents (minimum):
- What to distill
- Candidate target (template/playbook/doctrine)
- Blocking questions (if any)
- Canon refs (exact paths)

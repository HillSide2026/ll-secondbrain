# Stage 3.5 — Framing Variants Test Results

## Summary
- TEST-FA1: PASS
- TEST-FA2: PASS
- TEST-FA3: PASS

---

## TEST-FA1
**Input:** Email explaining case delay to anxious client

**Output (scaffolding only):**

[STAGE-3.5 | FRAMING VARIANTS | SCAFFOLDING ONLY]

Variant A
- Framing lens: risk-minimizing, client-centered
- Core thesis: delay acknowledged with clear cause
- Key implications: trust preserved; expectation reset
- Assumptions: client values transparency
- Hidden tradeoffs: less focus on mitigation details
- What this framing deprioritizes: procedural timeline mechanics
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant B
- Framing lens: procedural, operational
- Core thesis: timeline revised with concrete next steps
- Key implications: reduces ambiguity; focuses on plan
- Assumptions: client wants process clarity
- Hidden tradeoffs: less emotional acknowledgment
- What this framing deprioritizes: relational reassurance
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant C
- Framing lens: empathetic, relationship-preserving
- Core thesis: impact acknowledged before explanation
- Key implications: reduces frustration; reinforces care
- Assumptions: client anxiety is primary risk
- Hidden tradeoffs: may delay key facts
- What this framing deprioritizes: precision timing detail
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant Comparison Matrix
| Variant | Stability | Risk exposure | Operational load | Reversibility | Escalation likelihood |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| A | Medium | Low | Low | High | Low |
| B | High | Medium | Medium | High | Low |
| C | Medium | Low | Low | High | Medium |

[USE / IGNORE / DELETE]

**Result:** PASS (bullets only, no wording, schema + matrix included)

## TEST-FA2
**Input:** Difficult conversation with opposing counsel

**Output (scaffolding only):**

[STAGE-3.5 | FRAMING VARIANTS | SCAFFOLDING ONLY]

Variant A
- Framing lens: direct, precedent-driven
- Core thesis: position stated clearly with boundary
- Key implications: clarity; limits drift
- Assumptions: counterpart responds to firmness
- Hidden tradeoffs: lower collaborative tone
- What this framing deprioritizes: relationship repair
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant B
- Framing lens: procedural, risk-minimizing
- Core thesis: focus on process and next required step
- Key implications: reduces heat; narrows scope
- Assumptions: process framing lowers conflict
- Hidden tradeoffs: slower resolution pace
- What this framing deprioritizes: immediate leverage
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant C
- Framing lens: collaborative, solution-focused
- Core thesis: invite mutual path forward
- Key implications: de-escalation; shared ownership
- Assumptions: counterpart open to cooperation
- Hidden tradeoffs: may dilute firm boundary
- What this framing deprioritizes: positional leverage
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant Comparison Matrix
| Variant | Stability | Risk exposure | Operational load | Reversibility | Escalation likelihood |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| A | High | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium |
| B | High | Low | Medium | High | Low |
| C | Medium | Medium | Medium | High | Low |

[USE / IGNORE / DELETE]

**Result:** PASS (approach options only; no reusable wording)

## TEST-FA3
**Input:** Update to partner about setback

**Output (scaffolding only):**

[STAGE-3.5 | FRAMING VARIANTS | SCAFFOLDING ONLY]

Variant A
- Framing lens: factual, operational
- Core thesis: setback described with immediate impact
- Key implications: enables fast decisioning
- Assumptions: partner prefers brevity
- Hidden tradeoffs: limited context
- What this framing deprioritizes: narrative background
- Uncertainty: low

Variant B
- Framing lens: risk-focused, mitigation-first
- Core thesis: highlight risk plus containment steps
- Key implications: aligns on exposure control
- Assumptions: partner wants mitigation path
- Hidden tradeoffs: less detail on root cause
- What this framing deprioritizes: process history
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant C
- Framing lens: context-first, explanatory
- Core thesis: explain why setback occurred
- Key implications: improves understanding; slower action
- Assumptions: partner wants diagnostic detail
- Hidden tradeoffs: may delay decisions
- What this framing deprioritizes: urgency framing
- Uncertainty: medium

Variant Comparison Matrix
| Variant | Stability | Risk exposure | Operational load | Reversibility | Escalation likelihood |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| A | High | Medium | Low | High | Low |
| B | Medium | Low | Medium | High | Low |
| C | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | Low |

[USE / IGNORE / DELETE]

**Result:** PASS (neutral framing; no preferred option)

# Growth Without Structural Drift (TM)
## What the Harvard Business Review Reveals About Corporate Growth -- and Why Structure Often Lags Behind Success

## Introduction
In a landmark Harvard Business Review article, "The Five Stages of Small Business Growth," researchers Neil C. Churchill and Virginia L. Lewis examined how companies evolve from inception to institutional maturity.

Their conclusion was simple but powerful:

Growth follows predictable stages.

What their research did not explore in depth -- but what becomes evident in practice -- is that corporate legal structure does not always evolve at the same pace.

As Ontario businesses move from early viability to sustained profitability, operational complexity increases.

Legal architecture often remains where it began.

This gap is rarely visible during calm periods.

It becomes visible during scrutiny.

## The Five Stages of Business Growth
Churchill and Lewis identified five stages:
- Existence
- Survival
- Success
- Take-Off
- Resource Maturity

Most Ontario operating businesses in the $1M-$8M range sit between Stage 3 (Success) and Stage 4 (Take-Off).

These are healthy stages.

They are also structurally sensitive ones.

### Stage 1-2: Existence and Survival
**Structure Is Simple -- and Sufficient**

At inception:
- Founders make decisions directly
- Ownership is straightforward
- Agreements are limited
- Governance is informal

Legal documentation at this stage is minimal but aligned.

Complexity is low. Exposure is limited.

### Stage 3: Success
**The Quiet Inflection Point**

Churchill and Lewis describe Stage 3 as stable and profitable, where delegation begins.

Operationally, this is positive.

Structurally, it introduces subtle pressure:
- Non-founder managers are hired
- Compensation models evolve
- Strategic contracts increase
- Banking relationships deepen
- Informal equity expectations arise

The business has grown.

The documents often have not.

This is the beginning of structural drift.

Not through neglect.

Through momentum.

### Stage 4: Take-Off
**Where Misalignment Becomes Risk**

In Stage 4:
- Revenue accelerates
- Headcount expands
- Capital conversations emerge
- Governance becomes layered
- Decision-making decentralizes

At this stage, systems matter.

Churchill and Lewis emphasize operational systems.

The same principle applies to legal systems.

Common observations in Stage 4 businesses:
- Shareholder agreements drafted years earlier
- Cap tables not independently verified
- Officer roles informally expanded
- Authority structures unclear in writing
- Contract templates inconsistently applied

Individually, these are manageable.

Collectively, they create fragility.

### Stage 5: Resource Maturity
**Institutional Alignment**

At maturity, organizations formalize:
- Governance frameworks
- Decision authority
- Capital structure discipline
- Documentation systems
- Accountability mechanisms

The defining feature of Stage 5 is not size.

It is structural coherence.

## The Structural Gap
Many Ontario businesses operate at:
- Operational Stage: 3 or 4
- Legal Architecture Stage: 1 or 2

The company behaves like a scaled enterprise.

The documentation reflects a startup.

This is not uncommon.

It is predictable.

The question is whether it is intentional.

## When Structural Drift Surfaces
Structural misalignment rarely announces itself during ordinary operations.

It surfaces during:
- Financing due diligence
- Investor onboarding
- Banking reviews
- Shareholder exits
- Disputes
- Regulatory scrutiny

The issue is not whether the company is "legal."

The issue is whether its structure reflects how it actually operates.

Alignment reduces friction.

Misalignment amplifies it.

## Structural Maturity as a Governance Decision
Businesses that tend to benefit from structured review share common traits:
- 2+ years operating
- Increased delegation
- Evolving compensation structures
- Growing revenue concentration
- Contemplated capital events
- Greater external scrutiny

This is not crisis.

It is advancement.

## Introducing
## Ontario Corporate Health Check (TM)
### A Structural Stability Audit for Stage 3-4 Businesses

The Corporate Health Check (TM) evaluates whether your legal architecture aligns with your current growth stage.

It assesses:
- Ownership documentation integrity
- Governance and authority alignment
- Capital structure readiness
- Contract architecture consistency
- Role clarity and accountability

It does not assume deficiency.

It evaluates alignment.

## Closing Perspective
Churchill and Lewis demonstrated that growth follows recognizable stages.

Operational maturity requires structural maturity.

If your company has advanced beyond its original incorporation footprint, a structured review may be appropriate -- not because something is wrong, but because you have evolved.

Growth creates complexity.

Maturity requires alignment.

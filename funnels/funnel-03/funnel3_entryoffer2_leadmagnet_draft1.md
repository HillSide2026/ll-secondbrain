# The Suspicious Transaction Report Wiki

## Recent Developments for Canadian MSBs and PSPs

## Introduction

Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) occupy a unique position within Canada’s anti-money laundering framework. They are not proof of wrongdoing. They are not investigative findings. They are structured regulatory disclosures triggered when a reporting entity forms reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

For Canadian money services businesses (MSBs) and payment service providers (PSPs), STR decision-making is both operational and strategic. It requires judgment, documentation discipline, and alignment with internal AML architecture.

This Wiki summarizes recent developments, emerging regulatory focus areas, and structured documentation practices relevant to Canadian operators.

It is intended as a knowledge resource — not individualized legal advice.

## 1. The Evolving STR Landscape in Canada

Under the reporting regime administered by FINTRAC, reporting entities must file an STR when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

While this statutory language has not fundamentally changed, regulatory expectations around how entities assess and document suspicion continue to evolve.

Recent examination trends indicate increased focus on:
- The clarity and coherence of STR narratives
- Consistency between AML policies and actual escalation practices
- Pattern-based analysis rather than isolated transaction review
- Internal documentation supporting threshold decisions
- Oversight of crypto-enabled and cross-border activity

Examinations are increasingly process-driven. Regulators may request not only filed STRs, but also internal decision logs, escalation notes, and documentation explaining why certain transactions were not reported.

In short, the regulatory lens has widened from outcome to architecture.

**Suspicion vs. Reportability**

Suspicion does not require certainty.

However, suspicion must be reasonably formed and internally supportable.

Regulatory review frequently examines:
- How suspicion was identified
- What indicators were considered
- Whether similar transactions were treated consistently
- Whether the reasoning process was documented

An appropriate filing decision without documentation may invite unnecessary scrutiny.

A documented decision — whether to file or not — demonstrates structured compliance.

## 2. Common Threshold Elevators Observed in Practice

Certain factors commonly elevate internal reporting analysis. These do not automatically trigger filing obligations. Rather, they often contribute to the formation of reasonable grounds to suspect when viewed collectively.

### 1. Pattern Elevation
- Repeated structuring activity
- Sudden transaction velocity increases
- Unexplained bursts of activity
- Recurring activity just below reporting thresholds

Pattern recognition is increasingly emphasized in regulatory reviews.

### 2. Source of Funds Opacity
- Inconsistent explanations of transaction purpose
- Third-party deposits or funding layers
- Rapid crypto-to-fiat conversions
- Obscured beneficial ownership signals

Opacity alone may not establish suspicion, but layered opacity combined with other indicators often elevates review.

### 3. Jurisdictional Complexity
- Exposure to high-risk jurisdictions
- Sanctions-adjacent routing
- Complex cross-border aggregation
- Movement through multiple intermediaries

Cross-border and digital asset contexts tend to require clearer narrative articulation when filing.

### 4. Customer Profile Deviation
- Activity inconsistent with stated business purpose
- Dormant accounts becoming suddenly active
- Volume spikes without commercial explanation
- Behavioral shifts following onboarding

Consistency analysis is frequently examined during audits.

### 5. Evasion Indicators
- Resistance to KYC clarification
- Altered or inconsistent documentation
- Conflicting transactional narratives
- Attempts to fragment transactions

Isolated indicators may not independently meet reporting threshold.
Converging indicators often elevate internal escalation.

**Over-Reporting vs. Under-Reporting**

MSBs sometimes face a tension between two perceived risks:

**Under-reporting:**
Failing to file where threshold is met may expose the organization to regulatory findings, examination friction, or administrative penalties.

**Over-reporting:**
Filing large volumes of weak or poorly supported STRs may create noise, invite follow-up questions, or signal inadequate internal threshold calibration.

The objective is not maximum reporting.
It is defensible reporting.

Defensible reporting requires:
- Structured threshold analysis
- Clear narrative articulation
- Consistent internal standards
- Documented reasoning

Balanced calibration is a hallmark of mature compliance architecture.

## 3. Documentation & Escalation Architecture

Many MSBs identify unusual transactions through automated monitoring systems or manual review. Fewer maintain structured written summaries documenting how suspicion was evaluated.

Regulatory reviews increasingly request:
- Escalation logs
- Internal communications
- Threshold reasoning summaries
- Evidence of consistency across similar cases
- Confirmation that AML policy aligns with operational practice

Where no written rationale exists, review discussions may broaden beyond the transaction itself.

Sophisticated compliance environments often incorporate:
- Transaction mapping summaries
- Threshold assessment documentation
- Draft narrative development prior to submission
- Post-filing internal control observations

These practices demonstrate process maturity and governance discipline.

Structured documentation does not eliminate regulatory review.
It strengthens defensibility during review.

**Confidentiality & Privilege Considerations**

STR filings are confidential by law. Disclosure to the subject of a report is prohibited.

However, internal documentation surrounding suspicion formation and threshold analysis may be reviewed during regulatory examinations.

Organizations should be mindful of:
- Who participates in escalation discussions
- How internal communications are recorded
- Whether legal counsel is engaged during threshold assessment
- How documentation is preserved

Where external counsel is involved in threshold analysis, privilege considerations may arise. Structuring that engagement carefully can enhance governance clarity.

Confidentiality obligations and privilege frameworks operate alongside reporting requirements and should be understood within the organization’s broader compliance structure.

## 4. When Structured Review Becomes Operationally Relevant

Structured threshold review commonly arises in situations involving:
- Cross-border flows intersecting with multiple risk indicators
- Crypto conversion or digital asset interfaces
- Pattern-based activity evolving over time
- First-time STR filing scenarios
- Internal uncertainty regarding the reasonable grounds standard
- Reputational sensitivity
- Intersections with securities or payment activities

In these contexts, organizations may seek structured review to ensure:
- Narrative clarity
- Documentation completeness
- Policy alignment
- Filing defensibility
- Internal control assessment

The objective is not reactive reporting.
It is controlled regulatory response.

## Operational Considerations for Canadian MSBs & PSPs

As regulatory expectations evolve, organizations may consider reviewing internally:
- Whether threshold reasoning is consistently documented
- Whether escalation pathways are clearly defined
- Whether STR narratives reflect structured analysis
- Whether crypto and cross-border monitoring align with reporting practice
- Whether internal AML policy matches operational reality

Periodic review of these elements supports regulator-ready architecture.

## Next Steps

If your organization:
- Has identified a potentially suspicious transaction
- Is uncertain whether reporting threshold is met
- Has not previously filed an STR
- Has filed but lacks structured documentation
- Operates in crypto or cross-border environments

You may consider structured threshold evaluation.

## Closing Perspective

Suspicion requires assessment.
Assessment benefits from documentation.
Documentation strengthens defensibility.

A structured approach to STR analysis is not merely a compliance function. It is an operational governance decision.

For organizations seeking controlled, regulator-aware support in threshold evaluation and reporting architecture, structured triage may be appropriate.

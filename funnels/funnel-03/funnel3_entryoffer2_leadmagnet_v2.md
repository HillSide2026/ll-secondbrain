# The Suspicious Transaction Report Wiki
## Recent Developments for Canadian MSBs and PSPs

## COVER PAGE (Hero Spread)
Primary Visual: Wiki Knowledge Tree (Full Page Hero)

Placement: Full-page hero visual on page 1. Text overlays positioned center.

### Visual Composition
- Clean, minimalist line-art tree.
- White or very light neutral background.
- No gradients. No clip-art styling.
- Calm institutional aesthetic.
- Thin, precise branch lines.

Tree Trunk Label (centered):
- STR Wiki (TM)

Five Primary Branch Labels (radiating evenly):
- Regulatory Developments
- Threshold Elevators
- Documentation Discipline
- Structured Review Indicators
- Operational Next Steps

Each branch ends with a small neutral icon (outline only):
- Regulatory Developments: subtle courthouse/column outline
- Threshold Elevators: simple up-arrow
- Documentation Discipline: document icon
- Structured Review Indicators: magnifying glass
- Next Steps: structured checklist icon

Keep icons 1-color, low contrast.

Background Image Layer (Optional, Low Opacity):
- Behind the tree (very faint, 5-8% opacity):
- Abstract compliance lines / grid network
- Or faint skyline silhouette of Toronto
- Or neutral financial architecture texture

Purpose: Add depth without distraction.

## PAGE 2: INTRODUCTION SPREAD
Text occupies left two-thirds. Right third contains cropped zoom of tree branches as subtle design continuation.

### Introduction Text (Final Copy)
Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) occupy a unique position within Canada's anti-money laundering framework. They are structured regulatory disclosures triggered when a reporting entity forms reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

For Canadian MSBs and PSPs, STR decision-making is both operational and architectural. It requires judgment, documentation discipline, and escalation clarity.

This Wiki summarizes recent developments and evolving expectations shaping STR analysis in Canada.

It is a structured knowledge resource -- not individualized legal advice.

## SECTION 1: Regulatory Developments
### Visual Direction
Use a horizontal divider line at the top of the page that visually resembles one branch of the tree.

Subtle background image behind text (8-10% opacity):
- Faint image of regulatory documents
- Abstract courtroom columns
- Or blurred compliance meeting environment

### Section Text
Under the reporting framework administered by FINTRAC, reporting entities must file an STR where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

Recent examination trends indicate increased focus on:
- Narrative clarity
- Pattern recognition across accounts
- Consistency between policy and practice
- Internal escalation documentation
- Oversight of crypto and cross-border activity

Regulatory review increasingly evaluates the process behind the filing -- not merely the existence of the filing.

### TEXT BOX INSERT 1: Suspicion vs. Reportability
Design Treatment: Shaded box with left border accent line (institutional blue or charcoal).

Suspicion does not require certainty.

However, suspicion must be reasonably formed and internally supportable.

Regulatory review frequently examines:
- How suspicion was identified
- Whether indicators were documented
- Whether similar cases were treated consistently

An appropriate filing decision without documentation may invite unnecessary scrutiny.

## SECTION 2: Threshold Elevators (TM)
### PRIMARY INTERNAL VISUAL CENTERPIECE
The Five Threshold Elevators (TM)

Placement: Full two-page spread. This is the diagnostic core of the document.

#### Visual Structure
Five vertical elevator shafts aligned side-by-side. Each shaft contains:
- Title at top
- Vertical arrow pointing upward
- 3-4 indicator bullets inside the shaft

Horizontal floors marked:
- Unusual
- Escalated
- Suspicion Formed
- Reportable

The top floor glows slightly darker (not dramatic).

Elevator 1 - Pattern
- Structuring
- Velocity spikes
- Recurring threshold proximity
- Behavioral repetition

Elevator 2 - Source of Funds
- Third-party deposits
- Crypto layering
- Inconsistent explanation
- Opaque beneficial ownership

Elevator 3 - Jurisdiction
- High-risk geographies
- Sanctions-adjacent routing
- Multi-border complexity

Elevator 4 - Profile Mismatch
- Activity inconsistent with onboarding
- Dormant-to-active spikes
- Volume deviation

Elevator 5 - Evasion Indicators
- KYC resistance
- Narrative inconsistency
- Fragmented transactions

Background Layer for Elevator Spread:
- Subtle vertical gradient or architectural lines resembling elevator shafts.
- Do not use literal elevator photos. Keep conceptual and institutional.

Supporting Text Below Graphic:
Isolated indicators may not independently meet reporting threshold.

Converging indicators often elevate internal escalation.

The objective is not immediate filing. It is structured threshold assessment.

### TEXT BOX INSERT 2: Over-Reporting vs. Under-Reporting
Design identical to first text box for consistency.

Under-reporting may expose an organization to regulatory findings.

Over-reporting may create volume noise and weak narrative patterns.

The objective is not maximum reporting. It is defensible reporting.

Defensible reporting requires:
- Structured threshold analysis
- Clear narrative articulation
- Consistent internal standards
- Documented reasoning

Balanced calibration reflects compliance maturity.

## SECTION 3: Documentation Discipline
### Visual Treatment
Background image suggestion (5-10% opacity):
- Faint image of compliance team reviewing files
- Abstract document stack with lines
- Or clean architectural blueprint imagery

### Section Text
Many MSBs flag unusual transactions. Fewer maintain structured written threshold summaries.

Regulatory reviews frequently request:
- Escalation logs
- Internal communications
- Threshold reasoning documentation
- Policy-to-practice consistency

Where no written rationale exists, examination discussions may expand.

Sophisticated compliance environments often incorporate:
- Transaction mapping summaries
- Structured threshold documentation
- Narrative drafting prior to submission
- Post-filing control observations

Structured documentation strengthens defensibility.

### TEXT BOX INSERT 3: Confidentiality & Privilege Considerations
STR filings are confidential by law. Disclosure to the subject of a report is prohibited.

Internal documentation surrounding suspicion formation may be reviewed during regulatory examinations.

Organizations should be mindful of:
- Escalation documentation practices
- Communication discipline
- Counsel involvement
- Record preservation

Where external counsel participates in threshold assessment, privilege considerations may arise. Structuring engagement carefully supports governance clarity.

## SECTION 4: Structured Review Indicators
### Visual Suggestion
Return to simplified branch graphic from hero tree. Highlight the "Structured Review Indicators" branch in slightly darker tone.

Structured threshold review commonly arises where:
- Cross-border exposure intersects with multiple indicators
- Crypto conversion activity is present
- Pattern-based activity evolves over time
- The organization lacks prior STR filing experience
- Internal uncertainty exists regarding reasonable grounds

In these contexts, structured review supports:
- Narrative clarity
- Documentation completeness
- Policy alignment
- Filing defensibility

The objective is controlled regulatory response.

## FINAL SECTION: Operational Next Steps
### Visual Treatment
Checklist graphic aligned vertically. Minimalist. Clean.

Organizations may consider reviewing internally:
- Is threshold reasoning documented?
- Are escalation pathways clearly defined?
- Do STR narratives reflect structured analysis?
- Does monitoring align with reporting practice?

### Closing Positioning
Levine Law provides:
- Suspicious Transaction Triage & STR Filing (TM)

Includes:
- Transaction mapping
- Written threshold assessment summary
- STR narrative drafting support
- Filing guidance
- Internal control observations

Designed for:
- Registered Canadian MSBs

Documentation strengthens defensibility.

## Design Summary Architecture
- Hero: Knowledge Tree -> authority
- Middle: Elevator Model -> diagnostic tension
- Lower: Documentation + Review -> governance sophistication
- Final: Controlled engagement path -> conversion

This structure balances:
- Institutional knowledge
- Operational relevance
- Measured escalation
- Clear next step

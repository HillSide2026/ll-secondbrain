- Thread routed by identity-match: subject line contains "kleenup" which matches client name Kleenup Cleaning Services Inc.
- No canonical `LL/1./<matter_id>` Gmail label confirmed on this thread. Routing is review-required, not canonical.
- Full thread body was oversized (88,050 chars); routing based on snippet content. Snippet: "Laura Hinton added a comment to the following document TERM SHEET based on kleenup precedent."
- ML1 confirmation and Gmail label assignment recommended.

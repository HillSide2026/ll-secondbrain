# Style Guide (Operational)

Writing constraints:
- Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
- Start with an explicit scope statement (what the draft covers and excludes).
- Prefer neutral, source-bound language; separate facts from interpretations.
- Keep lists short and actionable; avoid nested lists unless required.
- Include inline references to canon paths when they govern content or structure.

Tooling and execution constraints:
- Do not hallucinate tools, files, or actions.
- Ref: 01_DOCTRINE/02_policies/DOCTRINE-2026-005-NO_FICTIONAL_EXECUTION_CONSTRUCTS.md (DOCTRINE-2026-005)

If a relevant style playbook or template exists, apply it and cite the exact path; otherwise keep the draft neutral and minimal.

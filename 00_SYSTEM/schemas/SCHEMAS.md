## MATTER.yaml Schema (05_MATTERS)

Location: `05_MATTERS/{delivery_status}/{matter_id}/MATTER.yaml`

### Required Fields

```yaml
matter_id: string        # Required. Clio matter ID (e.g., "25-927-00003")
matter_name: string      # Required. Matter/client name
status: enum             # Required. Clio matter status
delivery_status: enum    # Required. Lawyer attention priority
fulfillment_status: enum # Required. Admin workload state
created_date: date       # Required. Date matter was created
```

### Optional Fields

```yaml
services:                # Optional. Canonical service list for active delivery.
  - service_type: enum   # solution | strategy
    service_name: string # Human label for the service on this matter
    status: string       # Optional service status
    playbook_ref: string # Optional playbook pointer
```

Legacy compatibility:
- `solutions` MAY be present and is normalized to `services` with `service_type=solution`
- `strategies` MAY be present and is normalized to `services` with `service_type=strategy`
- New authoring should use `services` only

### Field Enums

| Field | Allowed Values |
|-------|----------------|
| `status` | `Open` \| `Pending` \| `Closed` |
| `delivery_status` | `Essential` \| `Strategic` \| `Standard` \| `Parked` |
| `fulfillment_status` | `urgent` \| `active` \| `keep in view` \| `dormant` \| `inactive` \| `pausing` |
| `services[].service_type` | `solution` \| `strategy` |

### Non-Inference Rule

These three fields are independent. Do not infer any field from any other:
- `status` (Clio) does not imply `delivery_status` or `fulfillment_status`
- `delivery_status` (ML1) does not imply `status` or `fulfillment_status`
- `fulfillment_status` (Admin) does not imply `status` or `delivery_status`

### Derived Category: ML Active

`ML Active` is a computed category (not a stored field) defined by:
- `status` in `Open|Pending`
- `delivery_status` in `Essential|Strategic|Standard`
- `fulfillment_status` in `urgent|active`

`ML Watch` is a computed category for parked matters kept visible:
- `status` in `Open|Pending`
- `delivery_status` = `Parked`
- `fulfillment_status` in `keep in view|active|urgent`

### Example

```yaml
matter_id: "25-927-00003"
matter_name: "Stream Ventures Limited"
status: "Open"
delivery_status: "Essential"
fulfillment_status: "urgent"
created_date: "2025-09-27"
services:
  - service_type: "solution"
    service_name: "shareholder_agreement"
    status: "active"
    playbook_ref: "02_PLAYBOOKS/CORPORATE/WORKFLOWS/solutions/shareholder_agreement"
  - service_type: "strategy"
    service_name: "closing_negotiation"
    status: "active"
```

### Directory Mapping

Matters are placed in directories by `delivery_status` only:
- `Essential` → `05_MATTERS/ESSENTIAL/`
- `Strategic` → `05_MATTERS/STRATEGIC/`
- `Standard` → `05_MATTERS/STANDARD/`
- `Parked` → `05_MATTERS/PARKED/`

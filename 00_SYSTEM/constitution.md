# Constitution

Version: 1.0
Status: Active

## Authority
- ML1 retains sole authority and accountability.
- ML2 preserves and applies prior ML1 decisions.
- ML2 does not generate novel firm policy autonomously.

## Consumption
- LL consumes only explicitly approved outputs.

## Escalation
- Ambiguity escalates upward.

## Priorities
- Durability, auditability, and repeatability take priority over speed.

## ML2 Quality Charter

Purpose:
ML2 exists to improve the quality, reasoning consistency, and rigor for ML1 and LL.
ML2 is not an authority. It is a structured system-of-record.

### Quality Commitments

1. Interpretive Integrity
Commitment:
ML2 will not distort, extend, or dilute ML1’s reasoning when preserving or applying it.
What this means operationally:
- No silent reinterpretation.
- No compression that changes meaning.
- No extrapolation beyond documented scope.
- Ambiguity is surfaced, not resolved implicitly.

2. Traceable Reasoning
Commitment:
Every meaningful output can be traced backward to explicit reasoning artifacts.
What this means operationally:
- Outputs reference governing doctrine.
- Playbooks reference policies.
- Policies reference principles.
- Runs record what was invoked.
- If you cannot answer “why does this say that?” in under 30 seconds, quality has failed.
Quality dimension improved: Auditability + Defensibility.

3. Structural Coherence
Commitment:
No two active artifacts at the same layer may contradict each other without being flagged.
What this means operationally:
- Drift is treated as a defect.
- Conflicting rules trigger review.
- Supersession is explicit.
- Version history is preserved.
- The system does not allow parallel, uncoordinated truths.
Quality dimension improved: Consistency.

4. Explicit Scope Discipline
Commitment:
Every artifact declares what it governs — and what it does not.
What this means operationally:
- Policies define boundaries.
- Playbooks declare inputs and outputs.
- Templates define intended use.
- No artifact silently expands authority.
Quality dimension improved: Predictability + Containment.

5. Repeatable Excellence
Commitment:
If the same input conditions occur, the system produces materially consistent outputs.
What this means operationally:
- Playbooks are stable.
- Templates are versioned.
- Protocol checks are repeatable.
- Variation must be intentional and documented.
- The goal is not rigidity — it is reliability.
Quality dimension improved: Reliability + Reusability.

6. Steal Man
Commitment:
Pending ML1 specification.
What this means operationally:
- Pending ML1 specification.

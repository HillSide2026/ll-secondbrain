## Purpose

LLM-006_PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE_AGENT (“LLM-006”) enforces structural integrity of the project system by detecting doctrine violations, approval gaps, metric inconsistencies, cross-project contradictions, and migration errors.

It protects the constitution by enforcing structure, not flow.

- **LL:** Execution environment

---

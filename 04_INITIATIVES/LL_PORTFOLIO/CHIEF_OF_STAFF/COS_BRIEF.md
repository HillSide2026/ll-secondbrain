## Portfolio Health Summary

The portfolio contains 43 scanned project roots and is broadly healthy, with 40 on-track and only 3 flagged at-risk. However, the headline numbers overstate stability because the three at-risk flags all point to the same underlying problem: a project ID collision where `LLP-037`, `LLP-038`, and `LLP-039` are simultaneously assigned to both the `09_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT` tier packets and to newer growth projects in `07_GROWTH_PROJECTS` that use the legacy `LLP-NNN_NAME` folder format. The agent system is counting both the legacy folders and the canonical service-management folders, producing the duplicate IDs flagged in CONTRADICTION_ALERTS. The real cash flow picture is less alarming: the active intake funnel (LLP-011, Funnel 1) is executing with no violations, and the two next-stage funnels (LLP-012 Funnel 2, LLP-013 Funnel 3) are in Planning with known open gates. The structural problem is the ID collision itself, and it needs ML1 direction before the next governance run can produce clean output.

## Cash Flow Priority — Top Actions

**LLP-011 Funnel 1 (Executing) — no action needed, monitor only.** The live Google Ads acquisition funnel is on-track with no stage gate violations. This is the sole active revenue intake channel. No ML1 action is required here, but the executing-stage artifact set should be kept current by the system.

**LLP-012 Funnel 2 (Planning) — planning packet completion is the gate to execution.** Funnel 2 is the growth-stage corporate-law acquisition path. Initiation is approved and planning is authorized, but the Planning → Executing gate is not closed. This directly affects whether a second revenue stream can be activated. The system can draft the remaining planning artifacts; ML1 must close the gate when the packet is complete.

**LLP-013 Funnel 3 (Planning, watch) — the payments/MSB/PSP funnel is in planning with an acknowledged watch status.** Funnel 3 targets the regulated-domain offer cluster (MSB Health Check, Suspicious Transaction Triage, RPAA Reporting). It cleared Initiating → Planning, but the planning packet is not complete and the Planning → Executing gate remains explicitly closed. This is the highest near-term revenue surface after Funnel 1, and its status has been watch since at least March 2026.

## What Requires ML1 Input

**ID collision resolution for LLP-037, LLP-038, LLP-039 — ML1_REQUIRED.** Three project IDs are assigned to both the `09_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT` tier packets and to newer `07_GROWTH_PROJECTS` folders using the legacy suffixed format. The governance agent has flagged these as duplicate identifiers (CONTRADICTION_ALERTS), and the project management agent is counting them twice, producing the spurious at-risk flags. ML1 must either reassign the growth projects to new IDs (LLP-045 onward) or confirm a different resolution. This is a structural governance decision because POL-073 prohibits duplicate IDs, and no agent can resolve it unilaterally. It unblocks clean governance runs and eliminates false-positive at-risk signals. The growth project in question (`LLP-037_LL_SYSTEM_DESIGN`) is a Planning-stage strategic systems project; it is real work and needs its own clean ID.

**LLP-037_LL_SYSTEM_DESIGN planning packet completion — ML1_REQUIRED for gate closure.** The system design project (currently carrying the conflicted LLP-037 ID) is in Planning with 6 missing artifacts: PROJECT_PLAN, DEPENDENCIES, RISK_REGISTER, COMMUNICATION_PLAN, METRICS, and BUSINESS_CASE. The system can draft most of these artifacts. But ML1 must approve the Planning → Executing gate when the packet is ready, and must confirm whether BUSINESS_CASE is required (that depends on whether this is classified as a strategic project). Cash flow impact is indirect: this project governs the technology architecture that affects LL-WrkEngine, ll-corporate, and the Legal Work System layer, which in turn affects delivery capacity.

**LLP-038 (whichever project currently holds this ID with the initiation gap) — ML1_REQUIRED.** The governance agent identifies a missing APPROVAL_RECORD.md for the project scanned as LLP-038 at-risk. An APPROVAL_RECORD is an ML1-signed artifact; it cannot be drafted by the system and then treated as approved. ML1 must sign off on initiation for this project before it can advance. Once the ID collision is resolved, this action will target the correct project clearly.

**LLP-012 Funnel 2 — Planning → Executing gate decision — ML1_REQUIRED.** The planning packet for Funnel 2 is open. When the system completes the remaining planning artifacts, ML1 must review and close the gate. This is the direct next revenue activation decision after Funnel 1.

**LLP-013 Funnel 3 — sustained watch condition — ML1_REQUIRED for gate.** Funnel 3 has been in Planning at watch status since March 2026. ML1 should confirm whether this project is actively progressing or should be formally held until capacity permits. The Planning → Executing gate for Funnel 3 remains explicitly blocked pending ML1 approval.

**28 projects in Initiating stage holding for ML1 review.** The portfolio system flags these projects as holding in Initiating until ML1 review. Many of these are placeholder-level packet slots with no substantive content (LLP-031, 032, 033, 034, 035, 036, etc.). ML1 does not need to action all of these at once, but the volume of held projects creates governance noise. A single session decision on which Initiating slots are genuinely active versus indefinitely parked would materially clean up the portfolio signal.

## What the System Can Handle

**Draft missing planning artifacts for LLP-037_LL_SYSTEM_DESIGN.** The planning/README.md lists DEPENDENCIES.md and RISK_REGISTER.md as anticipated artifacts that have not yet been created. COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md, PROJECT_PLAN.md, and METRICS.md are also missing. The system can draft all five based on the existing SCOPE_STATEMENT.md and PHASE_1_DEPLOYMENT.md. No ML1 approval is needed to create drafts; ML1 approval is needed to close the stage gate.

**Draft missing planning artifacts for LLP-012 Funnel 2.** The system knows the funnel definition from funnel-02/README.md and FUNNEL_SPEC.md. It can draft the remaining planning packet artifacts for ML1 review. No approval needed to draft; approval needed to gate.

**Draft missing planning artifacts for LLP-013 Funnel 3.** Same as Funnel 2. Existing artifacts (funnel-03/README.md, FUNNEL_SPEC.md, BD_NETWORKING_PLAN.md, traffic.yaml) provide the planning basis. The system can draft the missing packet elements.

**Keep LLP-011 Funnel 1 executing-stage artifacts current.** The system can maintain EXECUTION_LOG.md, STATUS_REPORT.md, KPI_DASHBOARD.md, and related executing artifacts without ML1 input, as long as no scope or gate decision is implied.

**Update LL_PROJECT_DIGEST.md and LL_PROJECT_DIGEST.tsv.** Both files are stale (last updated 2026-03-19). The digest now references deprecated paths (`01_ACCOUNTING/`, `06_FINANCIAL_PORTFOLIO/`) and does not include the newer projects (LLP-037_LL_SYSTEM_DESIGN, LLP-044, and the service management identifiers as resolved). The system can regenerate the digest from current folder state. ML1 should review the updated digest before it becomes the authoritative source.

**Normalize LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md.** The report was last updated 2026-05-15 but still contains the unresolved ID note for LLP-037/038/039 and references the old health snapshot from 2026-04-04. The system can refresh this from the current portfolio management outputs once the ID collision is resolved.

## Cross-Agent Conflicts

No cross-agent conflicts detected in this run in the strict sense of LLM-005 recommending flow advancement for a project that LLM-006 has placed on compliance hold. The three projects flagged at-risk by LLM-004/005 are the same projects flagged by LLM-006 for stage gate violations, so there is agreement rather than conflict.

The more significant structural tension in this run is between the portfolio dashboard (which shows LLP-037/038/039 as on-track in their service-management identity and simultaneously at-risk in their growth-project identity) and the governance audit (which flags the duplicate IDs as contradictions). This is a data integrity problem, not a cross-agent conflict in the strict sense, but it produces misleading portfolio health signals until resolved.

## Governance Holds

**LLP-037_LL_SYSTEM_DESIGN (Planning, 6 missing artifacts):** Cannot advance to Executing until PROJECT_PLAN, DEPENDENCIES, RISK_REGISTER, COMMUNICATION_PLAN, METRICS, and BUSINESS_CASE are present and ML1 closes the Planning → Executing gate. System can draft; ML1 must gate.

**LLP-038 at-risk project (Unstaged/Initiating, 7 missing initiation artifacts including APPROVAL_RECORD):** Cannot advance to any next stage without ML1-signed APPROVAL_RECORD. ID must be resolved before artifact remediation is meaningful.

**LLP-039 at-risk project (Planning, 6 missing artifacts):** Cannot advance to Executing. Same sequencing applies: ID resolution first, then artifact remediation.

**LLP-012 Funnel 2 (Planning → Executing gate not closed):** Execution is explicitly held until ML1 closes the gate. System can complete the planning packet; gate closure requires ML1.

**LLP-013 Funnel 3 (Planning → Executing gate explicitly blocked):** Execution remains gated. Governance note in funnel-03/README.md is explicit that publishing, paid channel launch, checkout activation, and external promotion remain gated pending ML1 approval at the launch boundary.

## Flow Bottlenecks

The dominant systemic drag is the planning packet deficit concentrated in projects at Stage 2 (Planning). Nine projects are in the planning/measurement stage, and the total portfolio planning gap count is 163. The two most common missing artifacts across all planning-stage projects are DEPENDENCIES.md (missing in 2 projects) and COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md (missing in 2 projects). PROJECT_PLAN.md, RISK_REGISTER.md, ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md, and METRICS.md each appear in at least one project gap list. This suggests that planning packets are being started but not completed before projects stall, producing a consistent pattern of partially-built Stage 2 work. The sequencing recommendation from LLM-005 is to concentrate resources on closing existing Stage 2 gaps before opening new projects.

A secondary bottleneck is the 28-project Initiating queue holding for ML1 review. Many of these are placeholder packets with no substantive content. Until ML1 makes a go/hold/park decision on each, the portfolio management layer cannot produce meaningful signal about whether these represent real work in progress or inert registry slots.

---

## Doctrine Drift Signal

The repeated omission of DEPENDENCIES.md and COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md across Planning-stage projects suggests a systemic pattern where projects enter Planning and complete the scope-and-risk artifacts but stop before completing the coordination and dependency artifacts. This is a planning discipline drift consistent with the POL-073 planning baseline requirement. The fact that it appears across projects in different program areas (Growth Projects, Service Management) rather than in a single cluster suggests it is a workflow habit, not a project-specific failure.

The ID collision issue (LLP-037/038/039 appearing twice) is a more acute conformance failure under POL-073 Section 5 (identity control). Duplicate IDs produce corrupted governance outputs and cannot be resolved by the system alone.

---

## Deferred Items

- Practice area packets (LLP-015, LLP-035, LLP-036) remain README-only stubs with no initiation artifacts. No urgency but the pattern should be addressed when growth project capacity permits.
- LLP-042 (Portfolio Management) and LLP-043 (Project Management) are flagged as "Not yet reviewed" in their Last ML1 Review Date fields. These are the control surfaces that produce portfolio governance outputs. They are operational but carry an unreviewed status flag.
- LLP-002 Budgeting and LLP-044 Finance are both in Initiating with no imminent cash flow pressure. Deferred.
- The LL_PROJECT_DIGEST.tsv remains stale with deprecated folder paths. Refresh is deferred until after the ID collision is resolved.

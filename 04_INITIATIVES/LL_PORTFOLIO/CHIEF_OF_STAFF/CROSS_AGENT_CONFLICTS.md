# Cross-Agent Conflicts

## Conflicts

No cross-agent conflicts detected in this run in the strict sense: LLM-005 has not recommended advancing a project that LLM-006 has placed on a compliance hold. The three at-risk projects (flagged by LLM-004 and LLM-005) are the same projects flagged by LLM-006 for stage gate violations, so the agents are in agreement.

### Portfolio Signal Contradiction — LLP-037, LLP-038, LLP-039

- **LLM-005 signal:** The PORTFOLIO_STATUS_DASHBOARD shows LLP-037, LLP-038, and LLP-039 simultaneously in two states: once as at-risk Planning/Unstaged projects (rows with 6–7 open gate violations, health=at-risk) and once as on-track Initiating projects (rows showing health=on-track, 0 open gates). Both readings exist in the same dashboard run.
- **LLM-006 signal:** CONTRADICTION_ALERTS flags duplicate project identifiers for all three IDs. STAGE_GATE_VIOLATION_REPORT flags the same three IDs for critical missing artifacts.
- **Conflict type:** Not a Flow-vs-Compliance conflict but a Data-Integrity-vs-Governance conflict. The dashboard cannot give ML1 a reliable health read on these IDs because the same ID points to two different physical projects. LLM-005 cannot give a valid sequencing recommendation for a project with a split identity.
- **ML1 decision needed:** Assign new canonical IDs to the growth project folders that are currently using conflicted LLP-037/038/039 identifiers, resolving the duplication. The service-management packets (09_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT parent, ESSENTIAL, STRATEGIC) retain their current IDs; the growth projects receive new IDs from the LLP-045 series onward.

## Summary

- Total strict cross-agent conflicts (LLM-005 advances / LLM-006 holds same project): 0
- Portfolio signal contradictions requiring ML1 resolution: 1 (the LLP-037/038/039 ID collision producing split health reads)
- Agent agreement on at-risk projects: all three agents agree that the projects currently scanned under the conflicted IDs have material stage gate deficits and cannot advance without remediation

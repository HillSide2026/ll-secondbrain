# Tier 1 Solutions Substance Review

## Scope

Reviewed Tier 1 Corporate Solutions:
- `INCORPORATION`
- `SHAREHOLDER_AGREEMENT`
- `SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE`

Review basis:
- packet substance quality
- execution determinism
- artifact completeness
- dependency/reference integrity
- status-gate readiness (`draft -> proposed`)

## Summary Verdict

Tier 1 packets are directionally strong, but not yet ready to advance from `draft` to `proposed`.

Primary blockers:
1. unresolved dependency library references (Issue Maps / Decision Lenses / Regulatory Surfaces / Question Banks)
2. insufficient deterministic assembly specification in `SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE`

## Findings (Ordered by Severity)

## Critical

### F1: Referenced component IDs are not implemented as addressable artifacts

Tier 1 assembly files reference IDs such as `IM-*`, `DL-*`, `RS-*`, and `QB-*`, but the corresponding corporate component directories currently contain only top-level README files and no per-ID artifacts.

Impact:
- weakens auditability and reproducibility
- prevents deterministic cross-reference checks
- blocks clean `draft -> proposed` promotion under status gates

## High

### F2: `SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE` lacks deterministic assembly depth compared with other Tier 1 packets

`SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE/SOLUTION_ASSEMBLY.md` does not currently specify:
- required input table
- ordered execution sequence
- explicit gate checks
- explicit escalation routing rules

This is materially thinner than:
- `INCORPORATION/SOLUTION_ASSEMBLY.md`
- `SHAREHOLDER_AGREEMENT/SOLUTION_ASSEMBLY.md`

Impact:
- higher variance in execution quality
- difficult QA gating
- increased silent-assumption risk

## Medium

### F3: Dual-tree maintenance risk remains (`CORPORATE` and `substantive/corporate`)

Corporate content exists in:
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/CORPORATE/...`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/substantive/corporate/...`

Impact:
- drift risk
- unclear canonical source during edits/reviews

### F4: Status-gate process was implicit, not codified

Before this review cycle, no single corporate status-gate artifact defined required checks for:
- `draft -> proposed`
- `proposed -> approved`
- `approved -> deprecated`

This is now addressed by:
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/CORPORATE/PLAYBOOK_STATUS_GATES.md`

## Tier 1 Readiness Matrix (`draft -> proposed`)

| Solution | Packet Complete | Deterministic Assembly | Dependency Integrity | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `INCORPORATION` | PASS | PASS | FAIL (F1) | HOLD at `draft` |
| `SHAREHOLDER_AGREEMENT` | PASS | PASS | FAIL (F1) | HOLD at `draft` |
| `SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE` | PASS | FAIL (F2) | FAIL (F1) | HOLD at `draft` |

## Required Remediation to Reach `proposed`

1. Implement/attach addressable component artifacts for referenced IDs (or mark non-blocking references explicitly).
2. Upgrade `SHAREHOLDER_CHANGE/SOLUTION_ASSEMBLY.md` to include:
- required inputs
- ordered sequence
- branch logic
- required gates
- escalation criteria
3. Run one documented QA pass using the status-gate checklist.
4. Produce ML1 review packet requesting `draft -> proposed`.

## Decision Recommendation

- Keep all Tier 1 solutions at `status: draft` now.
- Execute remediation items above.
- Re-run this review immediately after remediation and then submit a `proposed` packet for ML1 decision.

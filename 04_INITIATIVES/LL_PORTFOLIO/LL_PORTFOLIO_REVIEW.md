# LL Portfolio Review

## Purpose

Provide one obvious front door for reviewing the Levine Law portfolio.

This file does not replace the underlying artifacts. It tells ML1 where to
start, what order to read in, and which agent outputs are authoritative for
which review question.

## Fastest Path

### If a current Chief of Staff packet exists

Start here:

1. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/COS_BRIEF.md`
2. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/ML1_DECISION_QUEUE.md`
3. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/CROSS_AGENT_CONFLICTS.md` only if conflict review is needed

Treat the Chief of Staff packet as current only if its `Input freshness` line
is at least as recent as the latest `Generated` timestamp in the current
`LLM-004`, `LLM-005`, and `LLM-006` management outputs.

### If the Chief of Staff packet is stale or absent

Use this review order:

1. `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md`
2. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/PORTFOLIO_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`
3. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md`
4. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/PROJECT_HEALTH_ROLLUP.md`

This sequence gives:

- program-level posture first
- portfolio flow and capacity second
- structural integrity third
- project-by-project drill-down fourth

## Canonical Review Stack

| Layer | Canonical File | Primary Use | Agent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portfolio synthesis | `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/COS_BRIEF.md` | fastest narrative read for ML1 | `LLM-001` |
| Decision queue | `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/ML1_DECISION_QUEUE.md` | ranked ML1 decisions | `LLM-001` |
| Conflict check | `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/CROSS_AGENT_CONFLICTS.md` | identify flow-vs-governance conflict | `LLM-001` |
| Program summary | `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md` | understand the 9 numbered programs | derived summary |
| Portfolio flow | `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/PORTFOLIO_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` | on-track / watch / at-risk, bottlenecks, sequencing | `LLM-005` |
| Structural integrity | `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md` | stage-gate, approval, metric, and schema gaps | `LLM-006` |
| Project drill-down | `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/PROJECT_HEALTH_ROLLUP.md` | project-by-project review | `LLM-004` |

## Drill-Down Files

Open these after the four main review artifacts above when the question is more
specific:

- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/PROJECT_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/SEQUENCING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/BOTTLENECK_ANALYSIS.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/RESOURCE_COLLISION_REPORT.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/WIP_LOAD_ANALYSIS.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/STAGE_GATE_VIOLATION_REPORT.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/APPROVAL_GAP_REPORT.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/METRIC_SCHEMA_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md`
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/DOCTRINE_DRIFT_REPORT.md`

## Agent Logic

The intended agent stack is:

1. `LLM-004` for project health and stage-gate review
2. `LLM-005` for flow, capacity, sequencing, and bottleneck review
3. `LLM-006` for structural and governance review
4. `LLM-001` for ML1-facing synthesis

Canonical agent specs:

- `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/LLM-004_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_AGENT.md`
- `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/LLM-005_PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT_AGENT.md`
- `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/LLM-006_PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE_AGENT.md`
- `00_SYSTEM/AGENTS/LLM-001_CHIEF_OF_STAFF.md`

## Refresh Path

The deterministic management-agent refresh path is:

`python3 00_SYSTEM/scripts/run_ll_portfolio_agents.py`

That script refreshes the `LLM-004`, `LLM-005`, and `LLM-006` outputs. A fresh
`LLM-001` run should then read those refreshed outputs and update the canonical
files under `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/`.

## Canonical vs Legacy Chief of Staff Paths

Canonical Chief of Staff outputs live at:

- `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/CHIEF_OF_STAFF/`

Legacy duplicate pointer files still exist at:

- `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/CHIEF_OF_STAFF/`

Those legacy duplicates are not authoritative and should not be used for ML1
review.

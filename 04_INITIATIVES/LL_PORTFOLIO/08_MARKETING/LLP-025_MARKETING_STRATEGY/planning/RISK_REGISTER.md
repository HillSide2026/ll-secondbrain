# Risk Register

Project ID: LLP-025
Project Path: 08_MARKETING/LLP-025_MARKETING_STRATEGY
Stage: Planning

## Strategic Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SR-01 | No viable channel identified for ICP-02 — mature Ontario operating companies are not reachable through any cost-effective marketing channel | Medium | High | WS-01 evaluates multiple hypotheses (referral network, LinkedIn, targeted SEO) in parallel; if no channel is viable, strategy pivots to referral-only acquisition and marketing scope is redefined |
| SR-02 | F02 Corporate Health Check does not convert — operators pay for the diagnostic but do not proceed to remediation or retainer | Medium | High | Conversion Architect agent designs F02 conversion architecture before launch; success criteria include minimum retainer conversion threshold before F01 wind-down is triggered |
| SR-03 | Positioning drift under optimization pressure — agents or funnel changes gradually erode ICP quality in favor of volume | Medium | High | Strategic Editor is the coherence gate on all changes; positioning overrides metrics; no metric threshold may be set that incentivizes ICP dilution |
| SR-04 | F01 wind-down is triggered prematurely — F02 is not performing sufficiently when F01 is reduced | Low | Very High | Wind-down framework requires explicit ML1 approval; F02 must meet minimum performance thresholds before any F01 reduction |

## Execution Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ER-01 | F02 build stalls — entry offer, pricing, and landing page are not completed within planning window | Medium | High | WS-02 is explicitly scoped; launch milestone is a planning gate deliverable; no Planning → Executing approval without defined F02 offer |
| ER-02 | KPI targets are set without sufficient baseline — provisional targets are inaccurate and drive wrong decisions | Low | Medium | 30-day baseline already collected; Phase 2 targets are provisional and reviewed again at Day 60–90 Phase 3 lock |
| ER-03 | Agent outputs contradict each other or drift from positioning | Medium | Medium | Strategic Editor reviews all agent outputs before implementation; Authority hierarchy: Strategic Editor > Positioning > ICP quality > metrics |
| ER-04 | GHL intake configuration does not support F02 paid diagnostic intake profile | Medium | Medium | Dependency flagged in DEPENDENCIES.md; GHL config review is part of WS-02 |

## Capacity Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CR-01 | ML1 review bandwidth constrains planning stage velocity | Medium | Medium | Planning artifacts submitted in batches; gate decisions scoped to clear questions with binary outcomes |
| CR-02 | F01 continues to generate low-fit intake during planning, consuming ML1 capacity | High | Medium | F01 qualification gate enforced by LLP-011; escalate to ML1 only if qualification controls fail |

## Financial Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | F01 CPL rises during planning stage, increasing cost of bridge revenue | Medium | Medium | Monitor F01 CPC/CPL weekly; escalate to ML1 if CPL exceeds provisional threshold |
| FR-02 | F02 build requires unbudgeted platform or design spend | Medium | Medium | WS-02 includes cost estimate as part of offer scoping; ML1 approval required before spend committed |

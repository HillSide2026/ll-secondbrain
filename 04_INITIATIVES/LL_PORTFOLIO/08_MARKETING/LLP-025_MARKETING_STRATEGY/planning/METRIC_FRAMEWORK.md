## Metric Philosophy

- ICP quality overrides volume. No metric may be set that incentivizes diluting ICP qualification.
- Targets are set in phases: provisional (Day 30–45), then locked (Day 60–90).
- Positioning overrides metrics. If hitting a metric target requires compromising positioning or ICP, the metric target is wrong.
- 30-day baseline data is available. Provisional targets should be set now.

## Funnel 01 — Reactive (Google Ads)

Status: Active
Role: Bridge channel sustaining qualified intake while F02 is built

### Known Performance Baseline (ML1-observed)

| Metric | Observed |
|---|---|
| Ad spend | ~$1,500/month |
| Target matters retained | 4/month |
| Actual performance | Hitting 4/month in best months only; average is below target |
| Matter quality issue | A portion of retained matters are very low value — fees do not justify intake cost or ML1 time |
| Implied CPM (cost per matter) at target | $375/matter ($1,500 ÷ 4) |
| Implied CPM (actual) | Higher than $375 given below-target volume |

### Conversion Model (Projected)

| Stage | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lead → consult scheduled | 25–30% | Most leads do not book — high drop-off at first stage |
| Consult → paid project | 40–50% | Reasonably strong close rate once consult occurs |
| **Lead → paid project (overall)** | **8–10%** | Blended; implies ~40–50 leads needed to hit 4 matters/month |

**Implied lead volume requirement at target**:
- To retain 4 matters/month at 8–10% lead-to-project conversion: need **40–50 leads/month**
- At $1,500/month spend: implied **cost per lead of ~$30–38**
- At $1,500/month spend and 4 matters: **cost per matter of $375**

**Key diagnostic from conversion model**:
- The primary drop-off is at **Lead → Consult** (70–75% of leads never book). This is the highest-leverage stage to improve — either by improving lead quality (so fewer leads are needed) or by improving the booking flow/nurture sequence.
- The consult-to-close rate (40–50%) is respectable. The constraint is not ML1's ability to close — it is the volume and quality of leads reaching the consult stage.
- "Paid project" is the output metric, not "retainer." A portion of these are single engagements, not ongoing relationships. This contributes to the low-value matter problem — single paid projects may be priced below the threshold that justifies F01 intake cost and ML1 time.

**Core F01 problem**: The channel does not reliably generate enough leads to hit volume targets, and the matters that do convert include a meaningful share of very low value single engagements. The channel is simultaneously underperforming on volume and degrading on quality.

### KPI Targets

| KPI | Definition | Measurement Source | Review Cadence | Provisional Target | Locked Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lead volume | Total inbound leads from F01 | Google Ads + GHL | Monthly | 40–50/month (to support 4 matter target at 8–10% conversion) | TBD | If lead volume is below 40, hitting 4 matters/month is structurally impossible |
| Lead → consult scheduled rate | Consults booked ÷ leads | GHL | Monthly | ≥30% (current upper range) | TBD | Primary leverage point — 70%+ of leads currently drop off here |
| Consult → paid project rate | Paid projects ÷ consults completed | GHL / Clio | Monthly | ≥40% (current lower range) | TBD | Currently performing at 40–50%; this stage is not the bottleneck |
| Lead → paid project (blended) | Paid projects ÷ total leads | GHL / Clio | Monthly | ≥10% | TBD | Current rate 8–10%; below 8% signals lead quality or booking-flow problem |
| Matters retained per month | Count of new matters opened via F01 | Clio | Monthly | 4/month | TBD | Hitting target in best months only |
| Cost per matter (CPM) | Monthly ad spend ÷ matters retained | Google Ads + Clio | Monthly | ≤$375 | TBD | At $1,500 spend ÷ 4 matters |
| Matter value floor | Minimum fee value per matter retained | Clio | Monthly | TBD — **ML1 must define** | TBD | Required to distinguish productive volume from low-value noise |
| % matters above value floor | Matters at or above floor ÷ total matters | Clio | Monthly | TBD — set after floor is defined | TBD | Low-value matters should decline as ICP gate tightens |
| 90-day retention rate | Clients retained at 90 days ÷ onboarded | Clio | Quarterly | TBD | TBD | Low-value single projects likely show low 90-day retention |

**Open item for ML1 — matter value floor**: Without a defined minimum acceptable matter value, hitting 4 matters/month is a misleading target. Four low-value single engagements at $500–$1,000 each represents a worse outcome than two $3,000+ engagements at the same ad spend. ML1 must set this floor before F01 KPIs can be properly evaluated.

**F01 Wind-Down Trigger**: F01 spend reduction is authorized only when F02 meets the locked retainer conversion threshold and minimum qualified lead volume. Requires explicit ML1 decision.

## Funnel 02 — Preventative (Corporate Health Check)

Status: Not launched — entry offer unbuilt
Role: Intended primary corporate acquisition path

| KPI | Definition | Measurement Source | Review Cadence | Provisional Target | Locked Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Health Check purchase conversion rate | Health Check purchases ÷ landing page visitors | Website analytics | Monthly | TBD — set post-launch | TBD | Baseline begins at launch |
| Health Check to remediation conversion | Remediation engagements ÷ Health Checks delivered | Clio | Monthly | TBD | TBD | |
| Remediation to retainer conversion | Retainers from remediation ÷ remediation engagements | Clio | Monthly | TBD | TBD | Key metric for F01 wind-down decision |
| Lead magnet download rate | Downloads ÷ landing page visitors | Website analytics | Monthly | TBD | TBD | |
| CPL (F02) | Spend ÷ qualified leads generated | Ads / analytics | Monthly | TBD | TBD | Compare to F01 CPL |

**Note**: F02 provisional targets cannot be set until post-launch baseline exists. Phase 2/3 KPI formalization for F02 begins 30 days after launch.

## Funnel 03 — Payments Authority (MSB/PSP)

Status: Active
Role: Vertical authority build; entry offers → AML counsel retainer

| KPI | Definition | Measurement Source | Review Cadence | Provisional Target | Locked Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cost per qualified lead (CPL) | Spend ÷ qualified leads (ICP-02 filter) | Ads + GHL | Monthly | TBD — set from 30-day baseline | TBD | Qualified = Canadian exposure, decision-maker access |
| Consult show rate | Booked consults that occur ÷ total booked | GHL | Monthly | TBD | TBD | |
| Entry-offer conversion rate | Entry offer purchases ÷ qualified leads | GHL / Clio | Monthly | TBD | TBD | Entry offers: MSB registration, AML health check |
| Entry-offer to retainer conversion | AML retainers ÷ entry offers delivered | Clio | Monthly | TBD | TBD | Primary economic metric for F03 |
| Content authority metrics | Impressions, CTR, time-on-page, lead magnet downloads | Website analytics | Monthly | TBD | TBD | Tracked by SEO & Metrics Master agent |

## Objective-Level Metrics

### OBJ-01 — Acquire Qualified Ontario Operators (ICP-01)

**What this objective measures**: The firm's ability to attract and convert mature Ontario operators into retained clients. Success is not raw lead volume — it is ICP-filtered lead quality progressing through the full pipeline to retained status.

**Pipeline stages**: `visitor → qualified lead → booked consult → consult complete → retained`

| KPI | Formula | What It Tells You | Leading or Lagging |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qualified lead volume | Count of leads passing ICP-01 gate (revenue ≥ $1M, employees ≥ 5, not in crisis) | Whether the channel is attracting the right operators at all | Leading |
| Qualification rate | Qualified leads ÷ total inquiries | Whether channel targeting is efficient; high disqualification = wrong channel or wrong messaging | Leading |
| Consult show rate | Consults completed ÷ consults booked | Quality of leads and effectiveness of pre-consult nurture | Leading |
| Consult-to-retained rate | Retainers signed ÷ consults completed | Quality of the consult itself; offer-to-ICP fit | Lagging |
| 90-day retention rate | Clients retained at 90 days ÷ clients onboarded | Whether retained clients are genuinely well-fit | Lagging |

**Failure signal**: High inquiry volume + low qualification rate = wrong channel or messaging attracting wrong audience. High qualification rate + low consult-to-retained = offer misalignment or ICP gate is wrong.

### OBJ-02 — Shift from Reactive to Preventative Entry Point

**What this objective measures**: Whether F02 (paid diagnostic) is replacing F01 (reactive Google Ads) as the primary corporate acquisition path. This is a structural transition, not just a conversion metric. The goal is a different *type* of client entering the pipeline, not just more clients.

**Pipeline stages (F02)**: `visitor → lead magnet download → diagnostic purchase → health check delivered → remediation engagement → retainer`

| KPI | Formula | What It Tells You | Leading or Lagging |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead magnet conversion rate | Lead magnet downloads ÷ landing page visitors | Whether content is attracting ICP-01 operators; quality of targeting | Leading |
| Diagnostic purchase rate | Health Check purchases ÷ qualified visitors | Whether operators will pay for a structural review vs. seeking a free consult | Leading |
| Health Check to remediation conversion | Remediation engagements ÷ Health Checks delivered | Whether the diagnostic surfaces real work and ML1 converts that finding into an engagement | Lagging |
| Remediation to retainer conversion | Retainers ÷ remediation engagements completed | Whether remediation clients see ongoing value in fractional counsel | Lagging |
| F02 vs F01 retainer conversion rate (comparative) | Compare retainer conversion % across both funnels | Whether F02 produces higher-quality retained clients than F01 | Lagging |
| F01 share of new retainers (trend) | F01 retainers ÷ total new retainers, tracked monthly | Whether the transition is actually occurring; F01 share should decline as F02 matures | Lagging |

**Failure signal**: Low diagnostic purchase rate = framing or pricing problem (see OQ-03). High diagnostic purchase + low remediation conversion = ML1 not converting findings into scope. The transition is not happening if F01 share of retainers is not declining.

### OBJ-03 — Establish Regulatory Authority in Payments/MSB Space

**What this objective measures**: Two distinct things that must both be true: (1) LL is being found and recognized as a credible authority in payments/MSB/PSP regulatory work, and (2) that authority is converting into retained engagements. Authority without conversion is brand-building; conversion without authority is transactional.

**Pipeline stages (F03)**: `content impression → engagement → entry offer purchase → AML/regulatory engagement delivered → retainer`

| KPI | Formula | What It Tells You | Leading or Lagging |
|---|---|---|---|
| Content impressions and CTR (payments topics) | Impressions and click-through rate on payments/MSB content | Whether the authority content is reaching the right audience | Leading |
| Qualified F03 lead volume | Count of ICP-02 leads (Canadian exposure, decision-maker access) | Whether authority content is converting to actionable pipeline | Leading |
| Entry offer conversion rate | Entry offer purchases ÷ qualified F03 leads | Whether the productized entry (MSB registration, AML health check) is compelling to this audience | Leading |
| Entry offer to retainer conversion | AML/regulatory retainers ÷ entry offers delivered | Whether entry offer clients see LL as their ongoing regulatory counsel | Lagging |
| Retainer ARR from F03 | Annualized retainer revenue from F03 clients | Economic output of the vertical | Lagging |

**Failure signal**: High impressions + low CTR = content is not specific enough to the ICP-02 problem. High CTR + low entry offer conversion = audience is interested but not convinced to purchase. High entry offer purchase + low retainer conversion = entry offer is satisfying the immediate need but not establishing ongoing counsel relationship.

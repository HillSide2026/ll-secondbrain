## Collision Log

> All items below require ML1 resolution before build.

### COLLISION 1 — Corporate Governance Triage Consult rate vs. ML1 rate in F1 shortlist

**Issue:** PRE-ENGAGEMENT_MONETIZATION_SHORTLIST.md (Product B upsell path) records the ML1 consultation rate as $475. The pricing table lists "Corporate Governance Triage Consult" at $859.

**Possibilities:**
- (a) The $475 rate in the shortlist is wrong / outdated — canonical ML1 consult rate is $859.
- (b) The $475 rate is a separate lower-tier consult (e.g., associate rate or an older product), and $859 is for a named triage product.
- (c) Both products exist at different price points.

**Pending:** ML1 to confirm canonical ML1 consult rate and whether $475 product still exists.

**Affected files:** `LLP-011_FUNNEL1_MANAGEMENT/PRE-ENGAGEMENT_MONETIZATION_SHORTLIST.md` (price table row for ML1 consult)

---

### COLLISION 2 — "Corporate Check-Up" vs. "Ontario Corporate Health Check (TM)"

**Issue:** The pricing table names this product "Corporate Check-Up" at a fixed $2,499. F2 positioning.yaml uses "Ontario Corporate Health Check" with a range of $2,500–$4,500. The shortlist and F2 docs use "Corporate Health Check (TM)."

**Three-part conflict:**
- Name: "Corporate Check-Up" vs. "Ontario Corporate Health Check" / "Corporate Health Check (TM)"
- Price: $2,499 fixed vs. $2,500–$4,500 range
- Tier: positioning.yaml includes Health Check + Workshop ($6k) and Maintenance Retainer — not reflected in pricing table

**Pending:** ML1 to confirm (a) canonical product name, (b) fixed vs. range pricing, (c) whether $2,499 is the intro or regular rate.

**Affected files:** `04_FUNNELS/funnel-02/positioning.yaml`, `LLP-011_FUNNEL1_MANAGEMENT/PRE-ENGAGEMENT_MONETIZATION_SHORTLIST.md` (price table)

---

### COLLISION 3 — STR Triage Consult price ($859) vs. Entry 2 price ($3,500–$7,500)

**Issue:** The pricing table lists "STR Triage Consult" at $859. F3 entry_offers.md prices Entry 2 (Suspicious Transaction Triage & STR Filing) at $3,500–$7,500 per incident.

**Likely explanation:** These are different products. The $859 consult is a scoped assessment/call; the $3,500–$7,500 is the full STR threshold analysis + drafting + internal debrief engagement. If so, the registry should distinguish them clearly.

**Pending:** ML1 to confirm whether the $859 "STR Triage Consult" is a pre-engagement assessment that gates into the $3,500–$7,500 engagement, or a standalone substitute.

**Affected files:** `04_FUNNELS/funnel-03/entry_offers.md`

---

### COLLISION 4 — "Six (6) Hidden Owner/Operator Mistakes" — funnel assignment and full title unknown

**Issue:** Title was truncated in the source pricing table as "Six (6) Hidden Owner/Operator Mistakes You Cann[ot...]." Full title and funnel assignment are unknown.

**Pending:** ML1 to provide full title and confirm F1 or F2 assignment.

## F3 Product Notes

Products 8–10 are $97 PDF/digital products not currently documented in any F3 content or scope file. F3 entry_offers.md documents three service-level entry offers (MSB Registration Mandate, STR Triage, AML Health Check) and four core offers — none of which are $97 PDF products.

These three products represent a parallel low-ticket F3 entry layer (similar to F1's Product A), and may benefit from the same GHL + Stripe build approach used in F1.

**No action taken** — pending ML1 confirmation of whether these are approved for the F3 product stack.

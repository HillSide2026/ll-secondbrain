## 1. Confirm Browser-Level Thrive Access Before Any Further Live Thrive Editing
- Problem: browser-valid Thrive editing access is not yet a clean, confirmed working path for Codex, even though WordPress credentials exist in `.env`.
- Why it matters: Thrive-built pages cannot be treated like ordinary REST-editable WordPress pages. Before any live copy work, the editing path itself needs to be proven end-to-end in the real visual editor.
- Current known blocker: the browser login attempt using `WP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` failed in WordPress, so the Thrive editor load path is not yet verified.
- Initial action direction: before any further live Thrive copy edits, require:
  1. confirmed browser-valid wp-admin credentials,
  2. browser-level editing access (local Playwright or equivalent GUI control),
  3. screenshot-first verification of login, dashboard load, and Thrive load,
  4. a duplicate/staging or rollback checkpoint before text changes,
  5. no production edits through REST-only fallback paths.

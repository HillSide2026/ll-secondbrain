## RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOUR NOTES

Check these specifically in Thrive's responsive preview (tablet icon and phone icon in the editor toolbar):

| Breakpoint | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| Desktop (>1024px) | 3-column card grid, 2-column hero layout, full table visible |
| Tablet (768px) | Card grid collapses to 2 columns; hero columns stack (image above text); table font and padding reduce per CSS media query |
| Mobile (480px) | Card grid collapses to 1 column; all columns stack; table wraps; hero H1 at 36px |

For the Columns element in the hero and Section 1: set stack breakpoint to 767px in Thrive column settings.

For the card grid Columns element: set the responsive column count manually in Thrive's responsive editor for tablet (2 columns) and mobile (1 column).

---

## BRAND COMPLIANCE NOTES

Cross-check these before submitting for ML1 review:

- No stock legal imagery. The hero image must be architectural or urban — not a gavel, handshake, courtroom, or generic skyline.
- All body text on white backgrounds uses #000000 (not grey).
- All body text on navy (#1D4771) backgrounds uses #FFFFFF or #D1D5DB.
- Accent red (#FF5E5B) does not appear on this page. This page does not use the red-accent token.
- All headings use Inter, not a serif or display font.
- Buttons use Inter uppercase weight 600. No sentence-case buttons.
- The light-blue token (#4BD1FB) does not appear on this page.

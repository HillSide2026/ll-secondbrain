## 1. Executive Summary

This packet represents the complete output of a multi-agent workflow to produce the Level 2 Industries / Industries Served pillar page for Levine Law. All work has been conducted within the repo as draft artifacts. No content has been published or staged externally.

The workflow produced eight deliverables:
1. SOURCE_PAGE_REVIEW.md
2. STRATEGY_BRIEF.md
3. PAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md
5. INDUSTRIES_PILLAR_PAGE_DRAFT_v1.md
6. EDITORIAL_QA_REPORT.md
7. STRATEGIC_EDITOR_REVIEW.md
8. CMO_RELEASE_PACKET.md (this document)

All files are located at:
`04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/04_WEBSITE/INDUSTRIES_PILLAR_PAGE/`

**QA result:** All six page sections PASS. No sections are blocked. No mandatory revisions required before ML1 review. Multiple non-blocking revision recommendations are noted for ML1 consideration.

## 2. Source Page Review Summary

Five source pages were reviewed:

| URL | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| levinelegal.ca/industries | Live (301 to /industries/) | Composite page that mixes Level 2 and Level 3 functions. Industry list is the only usable material. All other content (services, testimonials, firm overview) must be removed from the Industries page to comply with POL-051. |
| levinelegal.ca/industries1 | 404 — does not exist | No content. Treat as non-existent. |
| levinelegal.ca/industries2 | 404 — does not exist | No content. Treat as non-existent. |
| levinelegal.ca/ontario | 301 to /ontario-corporation-vs-federal-corporation/ | Legacy redirect to a blog post on provincial vs. federal incorporation. Casual tone. Not relevant to the Industries page build. Flag for legacy URL reconciliation per POL-051 section 5.4. |
| levinelegal.ca/ontario1 | Live at /ontario1/ | Franchise law soft landing page. Confirms correct Level 3 page pattern (audience segmentation, service list, lead capture form). Does not contribute content to the Level 2 Industries page. |

**Key gaps identified in current site:**
- ICP-02 (Payments/Fintech/MSB/PSP) is entirely absent from the current /industries page — a gap the new draft closes.
- The current page collapses Services, Industries, and general firm overview into one page — a structural violation of POL-051.
- Tone on the current site ranges from generic ("quality legal services") to casual blog voice — neither matches the approved brand posture.

## 3. Final Recommended Page Architecture

**Page:** Industries / Industries Served
**Level:** 2
**Canonical URL target:** `/industries`
**Navigation placement:** Primary nav
**Function:** Educational, organizational, routing — not conversion

**Six-section structure:**

| Section | Title | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Intro / Why Industry Context Matters | Establishes premise; no CTA |
| 2 | Industries We Serve | Card grid of six industries; links to Level 3 |
| 3 | How Our Advice Changes By Industry | Demonstrates sector-specific approach; differentiates from generalist |
| 4 | Common Industry-Specific Business and Legal Issues | Resonance section; issue lists by industry |
| 5 | Related Resources / Where To Go Next | Explicit Level 3 routing section |
| 6 | Contact / CTA | Restrained close; routes to Level 3 or Inquiries; no form |

**Elements NOT on this page:**
- Practice area descriptions (Services page)
- Lead capture form (Level 3 pages)
- Testimonials (Homepage or Level 3 pages)
- Firm introduction or overview (Homepage)
- Free consultation pitch as primary offer

Full architecture at: `PAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 4. Final Draft Copy

The approved draft copy is located at:

`04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/04_WEBSITE/INDUSTRIES_PILLAR_PAGE/INDUSTRIES_PILLAR_PAGE_DRAFT_v1.md`

**No changes were required by QA before ML1 review.** The draft advances as-is from content production through both QA reviews. Non-blocking revision recommendations from QA are noted in Section 8 of this packet for ML1 consideration.

**Strategic strengths of the draft identified in review:**

- The construction vs. payments contrast in Section 1 immediately signals sector-specific competence to both ICP-01 and ICP-02 visitors.
- The regulatory specificity in Section 3 (PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, RPAA) demonstrates genuine literacy for the payments space — this is a material differentiator for ICP-02 visitors.
- The Payments/Fintech/MSB/PSP issue list in Section 4 is the strongest section in that section — six specific issues, all commercially grounded.
- The CTA in Section 6 names both ICPs explicitly, confirming to the right visitor that they are in the right place.

---

## 5. Homepage Link Recommendation

**Primary navigation:** The Industries page must appear in the primary navigation per POL-051 section 5.3.

**Recommended nav label:** Industries

**Homepage feature section (if applicable):** If the homepage carries a secondary feature block highlighting the three Level 2 pages, the Industries entry should read:

> "We work with operating businesses across selected industries. Industry context shapes structure, governance, and regulatory exposure."

This descriptor:
- Signals that the firm is not a general-purpose law firm.
- Establishes the maturity-gated, sector-specific positioning.
- Routes qualified visitors to the Industries page without overpromising on the homepage.

---

## 6. Level 2 to Level 3 Internal-Link Map

The Industries page is the entry point for the following Level 3 page architecture (to be built):

```
/industries  (Level 2 — this page)
  |
  +-- /industries/construction        Level 3 — Construction and Real Estate
  +-- /industries/health-wellness     Level 3 — Health and Wellness
  +-- /industries/managed-services    Level 3 — Managed Services and Technology
  +-- /industries/food-agriculture    Level 3 — Food, Agriculture, and Consumer Goods
  +-- /industries/energy-logistics    Level 3 — Energy and Logistics
  +-- /industries/payments-fintech    Level 3 — Payments / Fintech / MSB / PSP
  |
  +-- /inquiries                      Level 2 fallback — General Inquiry path
```

**Recommended Level 3 build order by ICP priority:**

| Priority | Level 3 Page | ICP | Funnel |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | /industries/payments-fintech | ICP-02 | F03 |
| 2 | /industries/construction | ICP-01 | F02 |
| 3 | /industries/managed-services | ICP-01 | F02 |
| 4 | /industries/health-wellness | ICP-01 | F02 |
| 5 | /industries/food-agriculture | ICP-01 | F02 |
| 6 | /industries/energy-logistics | ICP-01 | F02 |

Each Level 3 page requires its own content brief, strategy brief, and QA cycle.

## 7. Industries Page Boundary Guidance

**Where the Industries page stops and Services / Inquiries takes over:**

| Function | Industries Page | Services Page | Inquiries Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| Who the firm works with | YES — by industry | No | No |
| How the firm works / engagement model | No | YES | No |
| Service descriptions and practice areas | No | YES | No |
| General contact / inquiry path | No (routes to Level 3) | No | YES |
| Industry-specific contact / opt-in | No (routes to Level 3) | No | Fallback only |
| Lead capture form | No | No | YES (and Level 3) |

**The Industries page must not:**
- Describe engagement structures, retainer models, or service scope (Services page).
- Host a lead capture form or autonomous conversion surface (Level 3 or Inquiries).
- Serve as the general firm introduction (Homepage).

---

## 8. QA Notes — Consolidated

**From EDITORIAL_QA_REPORT.md:**

All six sections received a PASS verdict. No sections are blocked. Three non-blocking observations were noted:

1. **Section 2 — Health and Wellness descriptor:** Minor wording revision recommended ("regulatory and licensing considerations specific to the service model" vs. "compliance considerations that vary by service model"). Non-blocking.

2. **Section 3 — Regulatory specificity in payments paragraph:** The paragraph names PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, and RPAA. This is substantively accurate and an asset for ICP-02 positioning. ML1 should confirm comfort with this precision in a marketing context before publication.

3. **Section 4 — Food section depth:** One additional issue point could strengthen this entry. Non-blocking.

**From STRATEGIC_EDITOR_REVIEW.md:**

The draft is assessed as coherent as a Level 2 pillar page throughout. Strategic verdict: COHERENT — Advance to ML1 approval. Four non-blocking revision recommendations were noted:

1. **Section 2 — Energy and Logistics:** Strengthen with one concrete differentiator (e.g., joint venture structures for project operations).

2. **Section 4 — Food, Agriculture, and Consumer Goods:** Add one to two more sector-specific issue points.

3. **Section 4 — "Ownership transitions" language:** Diversify language between the Construction and Energy sections to avoid perceived repetition.

4. **Section 5 — Ontario Operating Companies entry:** At implementation, visually distinguish the general entry from the industry-specific entries to guide visitors to the more specific routing options first.

**Elements identified as must-preserve in publication:**
- The construction vs. payments contrast in Section 1.
- The regulatory specificity (PCMLTFA, FINTRAC, RPAA) in Section 3.
- The ICP-02 industry entry in Section 2.
- The full Payments/Fintech/MSB/PSP issue list in Section 4.
- The restrained, non-conversion CTA in Section 6.
- The absence of a form, testimonials, or practice-area content.

## 9. Implementation Notes Summary

Full implementation notes at: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`

**Key notes:**

- No HTML or CMS files exist in this repo. The repo is the content-layer only. CMS or GHL implementation follows ML1 approval of the repo draft.
- The current website appears to use WordPress with Thrive Architect. If the site migrates to GHL, the same content and architecture documents serve as the build brief.
- The Industries page should be built with placeholder links to Level 3 URLs so they can be activated as those pages are built.
- Level 3 pages each require their own workflow (content brief, strategy brief, QA).

**Canonical domain question (open — requires ML1 direction):** Is this page being built for `levinelegal.ca` (current) or `levine-law.ca` (migration target)?

**Legacy URL reconciliation items (open — require ML1 direction):**
- /ontario redirect (currently pointing to a blog post)
- /ontario1 (franchise soft landing page at a non-canonical URL)
- /industries1 and /industries2 (404s — confirm no active redirects)

---

## 10. Open Items Requiring ML1 Direction

The following items cannot be resolved by this agent workflow and require ML1 input before implementation can proceed:

| Item | Description | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| ML1-01 | Approval of INDUSTRIES_PILLAR_PAGE_DRAFT_v1.md content | YES — required before any CMS/GHL work |
| ML1-02 | Regulatory specificity comfort check (Section 3 payments paragraph) | YES — required before publication |
| ML1-03 | Canonical domain decision: levinelegal.ca vs. levine-law.ca | YES — required before implementation |
| ML1-04 | Level 3 page build authorization and priority sequence | YES — required before Level 3 work begins |
| ML1-05 | Legacy URL reconciliation decisions (/ontario, /ontario1) | No — non-blocking for Industries page build |
| ML1-06 | Non-blocking revision decisions (Section 2 Health wording, Section 4 Food depth, Energy/Logistics differentiator, ownership transitions language) | No — can be addressed in v2 with ML1 direction |

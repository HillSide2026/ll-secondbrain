## External Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Required By | Notes |
|------------|------|-------------|-------|
| levine-law.ca (website platform) | External — ML1-controlled | WS-2 M2.3 (Payments page live) | Website update is prerequisite for LinkedIn Ads activation. MKT_WEBSITE_IMPLEMENTATION_AGENT owns implementation prep and repo-side fixes; live publish still requires ML1 to execute or direct execution. |
| LinkedIn Ads platform | External | WS-3 M3.2 (campaign launch) | Requires campaign manager access and approved budget. LinkedIn Ads minimum daily budget ~$10/day CAD. |
| BetaKit (media outlet) | External | WS-3 M3.3 | Editorial or sponsorship inquiry required. Pricing unknown — must be investigated before budget commitment. |
| RPAA regulatory calendar | External — regulatory | WS-3 M3.5 (RPAA content) | RPAA registration deadline 2026-03-31 has passed. Treat it as a historical buying trigger and shift planning to post-deadline applicability, remediation, reporting, and ongoing operating-discipline content. |
| CARF regulatory calendar | External — regulatory | Content phase 2 | CARF crypto reporting obligations begin 2027. Content targeting CARF preparation should begin in Q3 2026. |
| OSFI operational risk guideline | External — regulatory | Content phase 2 | September 2026 deadline for regulated entities. Content planning window opens Q2 2026. |

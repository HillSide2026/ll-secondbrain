# F3 Top-of-Funnel Content Strategy — Working Notes

## 0. ICP Scope

F3 targets fintech operators — founders, product leads, and compliance heads at
companies building or operating financial infrastructure that enables the movement,
storage, access, or lending of money or value.

**In scope:** payments operators (PSPs, MSBs, cross-border payment companies,
remittance platforms, stablecoin payment infrastructure); embedded finance and BaaS
operators (program managers, neobanks, card program operators); crypto wallet and
custody operators; lending and BNPL platforms; treasury and compliance infrastructure
providers tied to regulated financial activity.

**Out of scope:** securities dealers, investment advisers, portfolio managers, token
issuers, investment funds, robo-advisers, and any operator whose primary function is
holding or issuing value as an investment product rather than moving, storing, or
enabling access to it.

**Boundary test:** Is the operator building or running financial infrastructure that
enables movement, storage, access, or lending of money or value? → In scope.
Is the operator's primary function investing in, advising on, or issuing investment
products? → Out of scope.

For the crypto subset specifically, see Section 1.

Six ICP profiles are documented in ICP_PROFILES.md.

## 1. Crypto ICP Boundary

Crypto is in scope whenever the conversation is fundamentally about **moving value** —
using digital assets as payment infrastructure. It is out of scope when the conversation
is fundamentally about **holding or issuing value as an investment**.

### In scope

| Topic | Why in scope |
|---|---|
| Stablecoins as payment rails (USDC, USDT for settlement, cross-border transfers) | Payment function — directly triggers MSB/RPAA classification questions |
| Crypto businesses facing MSB registration (Virtual Currency Dealers under PCMLTFA) | Explicitly regulated MSB activity types |
| AML obligations for crypto-handling operators | Core practice area — operational compliance |
| On-chain settlement + off-chain payout architecture | Payment infrastructure design question |
| RPAA applicability for crypto-payment platforms | Payment function analysis |
| Banking relationships and bank onboarding for crypto businesses | Access problem — practical regulatory structuring |
| Stablecoin operators with MSB or RPAA classification questions | Classification is the entry point to every EO |
| Cross-border payment flows using crypto or stablecoins | Payments, not investments |
| Treasury operations using digital assets for settlement | Operational/structural — not investment advice |
| Embedded crypto payment features in fintech products | Same as embedded payments generally |

### Out of scope

| Topic | Why out of scope |
|---|---|
| Token issuance, ICOs, securities offerings | Requires securities law analysis — not this practice |
| "Is my token a security?" | Primary answer requires securities law — refer out |
| DeFi governance tokens, investment products | Investment function, not payment function |
| NFT investment schemes | Not payments |
| Exchange listings, token listings, cap table structuring | Securities/corporate, not payments regulatory |
| Portfolio management, investment advice | Out of practice entirely |

### The test

Is the question primarily about moving value from A to B, or about whether someone should
hold or invest in an asset? Moving value → in scope. Holding/issuing value as investment → out.

**Nuance:** Some questions start as payments and have a securities tail (e.g., "can we use
our token as the settlement asset in our network?"). The payments structure is in scope.
If answering fully requires a securities law determination about the token itself, refer
that piece out and handle the payments side. Both sides labelled clearly.

## 2. TOF Content Strategy Logic

### The core problem

The F3 ICP is not thinking about MSB registration. They're thinking about growth, cost,
speed, and product decisions. If the first content they see is "MSB Registration in Canada"
they scroll past — they don't yet have a frame for why it applies to them.

TOF enters the ICP's world on their terms first, and only introduces regulatory framing
once they've already decided this is a voice worth following.

### What categories 1–6 are doing

Categories 1–6 are fintech operations content, not legal content. Each targets something
the ICP already cares about before they have a legal problem.

- **Category 1 — Expansion & growth:** Operators thinking about new markets, jurisdictions,
  and product lines. Their growth frame.
- **Category 2 — Speed & reliability:** Product and ops people dealing with operational
  delays and failures. Their daily frustration.
- **Category 3 — Cost & margin:** Universal. Everyone in fintech cares about where costs
  accumulate. Widest net.
- **Category 4 — Infrastructure & rails:** How money actually moves. Attracts technically
  curious operators and product leads.
- **Category 5 — Product design & UX:** Founders and PMs making financial product decisions.
- **Category 6 — Stablecoins & new rails:** High-interest. Attracts the stablecoin and
  crypto infrastructure ICP and seeds the idea that new infrastructure creates new questions.

Together: establish that this voice understands payments — not just law about payments.
After 8–12 pieces of this content, the ICP has filed Levine Law as "someone who gets my
world." That is the trust deposit. No conversion expected.

### How the bridge works (categories 7–8)

Category 7 ("Why some countries are easier for payments than others") introduces regulation
as a market observation, not a legal alert. The ICP reads it as market insight.

Category 8 ("Why Canada behaves differently," "What makes Canada slower than expected") is
the true bridge. Still operational in framing — no mention of RPAA or PCMLTFA — but it
names the friction the ICP will encounter. This is where click shifts from "interesting"
to "this is happening to us."

**No CTAs in categories 1–6.** Save conversion intent for categories 7–8, and only softly
there. Introducing a lead magnet or consultation ask in category 1–3 signals marketing, not
expertise — it breaks the strategy.

### Conversion flow

```
Categories 1–5         Category 6          Categories 7–8        Mid-funnel (EO1–3)
"I follow this voice"  "this touches       "this is happening    "I need to understand
because they get       my product"         to us in Canada"      what this means for us"
payments
```

### Channel jobs

| Channel | Categories | Job | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 1–6 primary, 7–8 secondary | Build audience, establish voice, earn trust | 3–6 paragraphs, opinion-driven, operator register |
| Blog | 3–8 | SEO capture, reference content, long-form credibility | 800–1,500 words; categories 7–8 have real search intent |
| BetaKit | 1, 4, 7–8 | Canadian fintech audience; editorial credibility | Feature-length; pitch-based |
| Stablecoin Insider | 6 | Secondary ICP directly | Confirm format via channel research agent |

## 3. Timing — How Much TOF Runway Before the Bridge

### LinkedIn — 6–8 weeks before introducing bridge content

"A few weeks" is too short. At 2–3 posts/week, 2–3 weeks = 6–9 posts. Not enough because:
1. LinkedIn algorithm needs time to identify and distribute to the right audience
2. ICP needs pattern recognition — needs to see this voice multiple times before filing it
   as "a voice I follow"
3. Bridge content introduced too early reads as a legal pitch before trust is established

**Recommendation:** 6–8 weeks (12–20 posts) in categories 1–6 before introducing 7–8.
After that, bridge content runs in rotation alongside categories 1–6 — not a cutover,
a layer added on top.

### Blog — start all categories now; prioritize 7–8 for production

SEO takes 3–6 months to rank. LinkedIn sequencing logic is irrelevant for blog.
Start producing categories 7–8 blog posts immediately — they have the most direct search
intent from operators researching Canadian expansion.

By the time those posts rank, the LinkedIn runway will already be complete.

**Production priority for blog:** categories 7–8 first, then 3–4, then 1–2 and 5–6.

### BetaKit / Stablecoin Insider — pitch immediately

Editorial lead times are 4–8 weeks. Pitch now. By the time a piece runs, the LinkedIn
presence will be coherent enough that a reader who checks the profile sees a credible voice.

### Summary

| Channel | When to introduce bridge content (categories 7–8) |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn | Week 6–8 (after 12–20 category 1–6 posts) |
| Blog | Immediately — produce categories 7–8 first |
| BetaKit | Pitch immediately; timing is editorial |
| Stablecoin Insider | Pitch immediately once channel research confirms fit |

The bridge is not a one-time event. Once introduced, categories 7–8 run permanently
alongside categories 1–6.

## 4. Agent Architecture (Two Agents)

**Agent 1 — Channel Intelligence Agent**
Answers: where does this ICP actually live online?
Inputs: BetaKit, Stablecoin Insider, LinkedIn, fintech newsletters, communities, podcasts.
Outputs: ranked channel list, content format by channel, contribution pathways, audience
overlap map.
Timing: runs once to establish baseline, quarterly to refresh.

**Agent 2 — F3 TOF Content Agent**
Identifies exact topics and produces content for categories 1–6 (and eventually 7–8).
Inputs: ICP profile, category framework, regulatory calendar, industry news feed.
Outputs: topic list per category, content briefs, drafted content mapped to channel/format.
Channel distribution decisions informed by Agent 1 output, but topic identification and
content drafting can begin before channel research is complete.

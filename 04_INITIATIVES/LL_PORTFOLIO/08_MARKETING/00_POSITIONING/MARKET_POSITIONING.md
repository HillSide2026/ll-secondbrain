# Market Positioning

## Primary ICP(s)

ICP-01: Ontario Operating Company
- $1M-$8M revenue
- 5-30 employees
- 2+ years operating
- Accountant involved
- Document-ready
- Not in active crisis

ICP-02: Fintech / Payments Operator
- Canada exposure
- Commercially minded
- Structural clarity preference
- Regulatory awareness
- Decision-maker access

## Category / Market Definition

Primary Category:
- Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service (Ontario SMB operators)

Secondary Category:
- Payments/MSB/PSP Regulatory Counsel (Canada exposure)

Core Market Definition:
- Ontario-based operating businesses ($1M-$8M revenue, 5-30 employees)
- Fintech / payments / MSB / PSP operators with Canadian exposure

## Differentiation Thesis

- Maturity-gated intake (not crisis intake)
- Structural review orientation
- Regulatory systems literacy
- Operator-aligned counsel
- Productized entry points (Health Check, MSB registration, AML health check)

## Why LL Wins

- Preventative, systems-oriented counsel for operators
- Governance clarity and regulatory stability focus
- Structured entry points that filter for fit

## What LL Is NOT

- Pre-revenue startup counsel
- Crisis-only engagements
- Very small businesses below revenue/employee gates
- Pure litigation-driven matters
- Reactive fire-drill lawyering

## Pricing Posture

- Paid diagnostics and entry services (used to filter for fit)
- Productized entry points prior to broader engagements

## Risk Posture

- Preventative and stability-oriented
- Avoids crisis-only engagements

## Brand Posture / Tone Rules

- Calm authority
- Structural, preventative, systems-oriented
- Operator-aligned (not academic, not alarmist)

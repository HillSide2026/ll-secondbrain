# LLP-014 INTAKE MANAGEMENT

## Purpose

Governs the full client intake pipeline from first inquiry through to
onboarding. Coordinates and enforces pipeline integrity across three intake
subprojects: LLP-027 (Inquiries), LLP-028 (Consults), and LLP-029
(Onboarding).

## Scope

### In Scope

- Pipeline governance: stage definitions, handoff protocols, and stage-gate
  compliance across all three intake stages
- Cross-stage reporting: inquiry-to-consult and consult-to-client conversion
  metrics; pipeline health reporting to ML1
- Coordination between LLP-027, LLP-028, and LLP-029 — ensuring each
  subproject operates within its defined scope
- Pipeline integrity: ensuring no lead falls out between stages without a
  recorded disposition

### Out of Scope

- Lead capture infrastructure (LLP-026)
- Funnel content production and SEO (LLP-011, LLP-012, LLP-013)
- Operational client onboarding — matter setup, Clio provisioning (LLP-004)
- Individual subproject execution (owned by LLP-027, LLP-028, LLP-029
  respectively)

## Funnel References

The intake pipeline receives leads from all three marketing funnels via
LLP-026 (Lead Capture). Pipeline governance must account for multi-funnel
inquiry volume and source attribution:

| Funnel | Source Project | Inquiry Stream |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| F01 | LLP-011 | Personal injury and tort |
| F02 | LLP-012 | Corporate and commercial |
| F03 | LLP-013 | Financial services |

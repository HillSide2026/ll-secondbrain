# Problem Statement

Project ID: LLP-014
Project Path: 04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/LLP-014_INTAKE_MANAGEMENT

The client intake pipeline spans three distinct operational stages — inquiry,
consultation, and onboarding — governed by three separate subprojects. Without
a parent coordination layer, each subproject operates in isolation: handoff
protocols between stages are undefined, conversion metrics are not aggregated,
and pipeline failures between stages are not visible to ML1.

The risk is not that any single subproject fails on its own terms. The risk
is that the stages don't connect. An inquiry can be handled correctly by
LLP-027 and still not reach LLP-028 if there is no defined handoff protocol.
A qualified consultation can complete without triggering onboarding if LLP-028
and LLP-029 don't share a common definition of a qualified handoff. The
pipeline produces no aggregate conversion data because each stage tracks
only what it sees, not what moves through the whole system.

This project initiates the coordination and governance layer that makes the
intake pipeline measurable and reliable as a whole.

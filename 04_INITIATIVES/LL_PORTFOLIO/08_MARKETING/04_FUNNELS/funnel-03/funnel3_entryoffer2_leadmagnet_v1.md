# Lead Magnet Structure

## Title Options

Primary:
- Does This Trigger an STR?™
- A Practical Threshold Guide for Canadian MSBs

Alternate:
- Before You File — or Fail to File:
- A Structured Guide to STR Decision-Making in Canada

**Tone:** Measured. Authoritative. Calm. Procedural.

## Section 1 – The Real Risk: Under-Reporting vs. Over-Reporting

**Positioning message:**

Suspicion is not the same as reportability.
But failing to document your reasoning is the real regulatory vulnerability.

Clarify that under Canadian AML law, MSBs must report when there are reasonable grounds to suspect a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

Reference authority once for credibility:

Under the framework administered by FINTRAC, reporting obligations attach not to certainty — but to suspicion supported by reasonable grounds.

This section should explain:
- STRs are about threshold, not proof
- Over-reporting can create regulatory noise
- Under-reporting can create audit exposure
- The real issue regulators examine: documentation quality

CTA soft seed:

The question is not just “Did you file?”
It’s “Can you defend why you did — or didn’t?”

## Section 2 – The 5 Threshold Elevators™

Introduce a proprietary-looking framework:

**The 5 Threshold Elevators™**

These are risk multipliers that commonly move a transaction from “unusual” to “reportable.”

1. **Pattern Elevation**
   - Repeated structuring
   - Velocity anomalies
   - Unexplained transaction bursts

2. **Source of Funds Opacity**
   - Inconsistent explanations
   - Third-party deposits
   - Crypto-to-fiat layering

3. **Jurisdictional Exposure**
   - High-risk geographies
   - Sanctions-adjacent regions
   - Cross-border routing complexity

4. **Customer Profile Mismatch**
   - Activity inconsistent with stated business
   - Rapid account behavior changes
   - Dormant-to-active spikes

5. **Evasion Indicators**
   - Reluctance to provide KYC
   - Altered documentation
   - Narrative inconsistency

**Visual framing suggestion:**
A simple diagnostic grid showing:
- Indicator Present
- Patterned?
- Escalate?

This builds diagnostic authority.

## Section 3 – The STR Decision Map™

Provide a simple, clean decision tree:

1. Is the transaction unusual?
2. Does it create reasonable grounds to suspect?
3. Is suspicion linked to ML/TF indicators?
4. Is documentation sufficient to support your conclusion?

Emphasize:

If you cannot articulate the narrative clearly, you are not ready to file — and you are not ready to defend a non-filing.

That line drives the upsell.

---

## Section 4 – The Documentation Discipline Problem

Most MSBs:
- Flag transactions
- Discuss internally
- File (or don’t file)
- Move on

What’s missing?
A written threshold assessment record.

Regulators do not just review filed STRs.
They review internal decision-making processes.

This section explains:
- Why undocumented reasoning is a systemic weakness.

Introduce the concept of:
**Threshold Assessment Memo**

Without giving the full template.

## Section 5 – When to Escalate to Structured Triage

Clear pivot to entry offer:

Escalation is appropriate when:
- Cross-border exposure exists
- Crypto is involved
- There is reputational sensitivity
- The transaction intersects with securities activity
- You lack internal AML confidence

Then introduce the service:

🚪 **Introducing**
**Suspicious Transaction Triage & STR Filing™**

Positioning copy:

When a transaction crosses the line — or might — we provide:
- Structured transaction mapping
- Threshold assessment with written rationale
- STR narrative drafting support
- Filing defensibility alignment
- Internal control observations

Measured statement:

We do not “rush-file.”
We assess, document, and position your report carefully.

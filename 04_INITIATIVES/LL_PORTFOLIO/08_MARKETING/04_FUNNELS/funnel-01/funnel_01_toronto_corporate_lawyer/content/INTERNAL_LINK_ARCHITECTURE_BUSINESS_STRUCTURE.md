## Per-Page Link Specification

### Pillar Page `/business-structure`

**Sections:**
1. What "Business Structure" Actually Refers To — ownership, control, economics, obligations
2. Why Structures Do Not Stay Static — operational change vs static documentation
3. How Structural Drift Occurs — incremental changes, no single triggering event
4. Where Drift Becomes Visible — investors, banks, internal stress
5. What Misalignment Looks Like — documents vs operation, control vs ownership, risk vs allocation
6. When Structure Becomes a Problem — not at change, at interpretation

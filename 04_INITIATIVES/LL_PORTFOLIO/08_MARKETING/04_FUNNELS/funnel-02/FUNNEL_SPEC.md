# Funnel Spec — Funnel 02

## Funnel ID + Status

- funnel_id: funnel-02
- status: planned

## Purpose / Role

Corporate-law acquisition path for growing businesses with at least `CAD 5M`
annual cash flow, unless ML1 grants an exception, using a preventative paid
diagnostic as the entry point.

## Funnel Distinction

Funnel 02 is the primary awareness-and-interest building path for growth-stage
corporate-law demand. It carries prospects from discovery through
consideration and inquiry before conversion handoff.

## Positioning Reference

- 00_POSITIONING/MARKET_POSITIONING.md
- ICP-01: Ontario Operating Company
- Category: Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service (preventative entry)
- Competitive framing: `COMPETITIVE_DIFFERENTIATION_MATRIX.md`
- Proof architecture: `PROOF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Target ICP (Must Match Positioning)

- Ontario-based operating businesses
- at least `CAD 5M` annual cash flow unless ML1 grants an exception
- 5-30 employees
- 2+ years in operation
- Accountant involved
- Document-ready
- Not in active crisis

Secondary planning hypothesis (research only):
- operators acquiring an existing operating business (independent or backed), pending cohort-comparison findings and ML1 approval.

## Entry Channel(s)

- Content
- Google Ads
- `levine-law.ca`
- overlapping NDA Esq landing-page acquisition surface on `levine-law.ca`

## Traffic / Acquisition

- Lead magnet: Growth Without Structural Drift (TM)
- higher-quality, higher-cost Google Ads traffic is allowed where it improves fit and downstream economics
- authority content / SEO is a core acquisition lane
- NDA Esq may act as a supplementary traffic and lead source for Funnel 02 where the acquisition surface overlaps, without changing project boundaries

## Intake Mechanism

- Go High Level (GHL) form
- Voice AI
- SMS follow-up
- SDR qualification call (mandatory for `intake_completed`)
- setter-supported qualification and scheduling

## Qualification Gates

- annual_cash_flow_min: CAD 5M unless ML1 exception applies
- employee_min: 5
- years_in_operation_min: 2
- ontario_incorporation_required: true
- active_operating_business_required: true
- accountant_involved_required: true
- pre_conversion_minimum_readiness_required: true
- post_purchase_document_package_required: true
- qualification_call_evidence_required: true

Required documents:
- articles and bylaws
- shareholder agreement
- director and officer registers
- key commercial contracts
- employment and contractor agreements
- option or equity documents
- minute book (if maintained)
- recent financing documents

## Core Narrative / Promise

Structured corporate-law and governance assessment for operating companies that
have outgrown their original setup.

## F02 / F03 Routing Rule

- Fintech corporate, contracts, governance, financing-readiness, and general
  commercial legal issues route to Funnel 02 where the F02 cash-flow and
  qualification gates are met.
- MSB, RPAA, AML, STR, payments-infrastructure, stablecoin settlement, PSP, and
  payments-regulatory classification issues route to Funnel 03.

## Conversion Event Definition

- health_check_purchased

## Pipeline Stages

ML1-approved 2026-06-07. Single pipeline. Canonical spec governs `pipeline.yaml`.

- new_lead
- worked
- qualified
- consult_booked
- consult_completed
- engagement_out
- retained
- closed_lost

`worked` = first outreach attempt (call placed, no answer counts). Stage/status
separation enforced: no-show, rescheduled, and unresponsive are opportunity
status fields, not stages. See `pipeline.yaml` for custom fields and automation
definitions.

## Diagnostic Offer Routing

The Corporate Health Check (paid diagnostic) is not offered to all leads
universally. Two lead types enter this funnel with different routing:

**Awareness leads** (source: health check content cluster — blog posts, pillar
pages): low problem clarity, arrived in learning mode, not carrying a defined
mandate. These leads are routed automatically to the diagnostic purchase page
directly from the inquiry form. No SDR judgment required at this step.

**Mandate leads** (source: referral, direct, event, networking): high problem
clarity, specific legal problem in hand. These leads are routed to a
consultation to scope and price the work. The diagnostic may still be offered
by the SDR at Qualified if structural complexity is identified, but it is not
the default.

Routing decision point: at the Qualified stage, the SDR sets `Offer Path` =
Diagnostic or Consultation based on lead type. Inbound content leads may be
pre-routed to Diagnostic via form logic before reaching the SDR.

## Lead Magnet — Corporate Health Check Access Point (Backlog)

Identified 2026-06-07. A Corporate Health Check lead magnet (distinct from
"Growth Without Structural Drift") should be accessible directly from blog
posts and the corporate governance pillar page. Its function is to give
awareness leads a frictionless path from reading content to initiating the
diagnostic purchase or inquiry, without requiring them to navigate to the main
services page. Format and specification pending ML1 direction. See
`funnel2_blog_backlog.md` for content cluster context.

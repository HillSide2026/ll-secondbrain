# Funnel Spec — Funnel 02

## Funnel ID + Status

- funnel_id: funnel-02
- status: planned

## Purpose / Role

Corporate-law acquisition path for growing businesses with at least `CAD 5M`
annual cash flow, unless ML1 grants an exception, using a preventative paid
diagnostic as the entry point.

## Funnel Distinction

Funnel 02 captures corporate-law demand at the trigger moment — when an
operator is already searching because something has happened or is imminent.
Ambient awareness-building is not the model: corporate legal needs at this ICP
stage are episodic, not ambient. The content cluster catches operators at the
moment of urgency; the checklist converts them.

## Positioning Reference

- 00_POSITIONING/MARKET_POSITIONING.md
- ICP-01: Ontario Operating Company
- Category: Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service (preventative entry)
- Competitive framing: `COMPETITIVE_DIFFERENTIATION_MATRIX.md`
- Proof architecture: `PROOF_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Target ICP (Must Match Positioning)

- Ontario-based operating businesses
- at least `CAD 5M` annual cash flow unless ML1 grants an exception
- 5-30 employees
- 2+ years in operation
- Accountant involved
- Document-ready
- Not in active crisis

### Working Corporation Taxonomy (ML1-approved 2026-06-07)

Near-exhaustive taxonomy of Ontario private operating businesses in the ICP
revenue band. Classification notes: VC-backed companies are digital by
definition and fall under Type 1. PE-backed companies are non-family-controlled
and fall under Type 3.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Start-up (digital) | Digital business model; typically founder-led; includes VC-backed; IP, equity, and founder agreement surface prominent |
| 2. Family-owned company | Controlled by a single family; succession, family governance, and shareholder alignment surface prominent |
| 3. Private company (non-digital, non-family) | Operating business not in a digital sector and not family-controlled; includes PE-backed; classic corporate governance, commercial contracts, and growth financing surface |
| 4. Foreign subsidiary in Canada | Canadian entity owned by a foreign parent; local governance compliance, intercompany agreements, and Canadian regulatory surface |
| 5. Professional corporation | Regulated professional practice (accounting, consulting, or similar); ownership and transfer constrained by professional body rules; distinct governance surface |

The 25-point checklist lead magnet applies across all five types at the pillar
level. Individual items within pillars may weight differently by type — to be
assessed when the checklist is produced.

Secondary planning hypothesis (research only):
- operators acquiring an existing operating business (independent or backed), pending cohort-comparison findings and ML1 approval.

## Entry Channel(s)

- Content / SEO (primary — see Traffic / Acquisition)
- Google Ads
- `levine-law.ca`
- Overlapping NDA Esq landing-page acquisition surface on `levine-law.ca`
- **Type 4 channel (under development)** — see below

## Type 4 Channel: Foreign-Owned and Controlled Subsidiaries

Status: identified as a focus channel 2026-06-07. Development pending.

### Acquisition model

Type 4 is search-driven, same as the rest of this funnel. The Canadian GM or
country manager of an existing foreign subsidiary operates as an independent
buyer — they have a specific problem, a local budget, and they search for help.
The foreign parent's GC is typically not in the picture for day-to-day Canadian
legal work.

Exception: new subsidiary setup (initial incorporation and governance) is more
likely directed by the parent's legal team. That is a one-time referral event,
not a repeating channel.

The opportunity is Type 4-specific content within the existing SEO strategy —
not a separate BD or referral relationship model.

### Decision-maker profile

Canadian country manager or GM. Independent buyer for operational legal needs.
Parent GC involvement is more common for major structural decisions (M&A,
intercompany restructuring) than for day-to-day corporate legal work.

### Trigger moments

- Employment issues with Canadian staff (distinct from home-country norms)
- Key commercial contract with a Canadian customer or supplier
- Canadian compliance review (regulatory, corporate records, annual obligations)
- Intercompany agreement restructuring
- M&A involving the Canadian entity

### Type 4-specific content opportunities

Search intent for this segment differs from Canadian-founded companies.
Relevant topics: intercompany agreements, CBCA vs. OBCA election for foreign
entities, Canadian director requirements, Canadian employment obligations for
foreign-controlled employers, subsidiary governance and minute book compliance.

These topics are distinct enough from the general corporate governance content
cluster to warrant dedicated pages or posts targeting Type 4 search terms.

## Traffic / Acquisition

- Authority content / SEO is the primary acquisition lane. The blog and
  content cluster serve the awareness function by being findable at trigger
  moments — not by creating ambient demand. There is no standalone awareness
  lead magnet. "Growth Without Structural Drift" is retired as a lead magnet
  concept. If retained at all, it is top-of-funnel brand content only, not a
  conversion asset.
- Sole lead magnet: the Corporate Health Check checklist (conversion asset).
  Spec: `funnel2_leadmagnet_checklist_spec_v1.md`.
- Higher-quality, higher-cost Google Ads traffic is allowed where it improves
  fit and downstream economics.
- NDA Esq may act as a supplementary traffic and lead source for Funnel 02
  where the acquisition surface overlaps, without changing project boundaries.
- Advisor referrals (accountants, financial advisors) are a referral channel,
  not a content distribution channel. The advisor play is relationship-based;
  no circulating asset is planned.

## Intake Mechanism

- Go High Level (GHL) form
- Voice AI
- SMS follow-up
- SDR qualification call (mandatory for `intake_completed`)
- setter-supported qualification and scheduling

## Qualification Gates

- ontario_incorporation_required: true
- active_operating_business_required: true
- accountant_involved_required: true

- key commercial contracts
- employment and contractor agreements

## Core Narrative / Promise

Structured corporate-law and governance assessment for operating companies that
have outgrown their original setup.

## F02 / F03 Routing Rule

- Fintech corporate, contracts, governance, financing-readiness, and general
  commercial legal issues route to Funnel 02 where the F02 cash-flow and
  qualification gates are met.
- MSB, RPAA, AML, STR, payments-infrastructure, stablecoin settlement, PSP, and
  payments-regulatory classification issues route to Funnel 03.

## Conversion Event Definition

- health_check_purchased

## Pipeline Stages

ML1-approved 2026-06-07. Single pipeline. Canonical spec governs `pipeline.yaml`.

- new_lead
- worked
- qualified
- consult_booked
- consult_completed
- engagement_out
- retained
- closed_lost

`worked` = first outreach attempt (call placed, no answer counts). Stage/status
separation enforced: no-show, rescheduled, and unresponsive are opportunity
status fields, not stages. See `pipeline.yaml` for custom fields and automation
definitions.

## Diagnostic Offer Routing

The Corporate Health Check (paid diagnostic) is not offered to all leads
universally. Two lead types enter this funnel with different routing:

**Awareness leads** (source: health check content cluster — blog posts, pillar
pages): low problem clarity, arrived in learning mode, not carrying a defined
mandate. These leads are routed automatically to the diagnostic purchase page
directly from the inquiry form. No SDR judgment required at this step.

**Mandate leads** (source: referral, direct, event, networking): high problem
clarity, specific legal problem in hand. These leads are routed to a
consultation to scope and price the work. The diagnostic may still be offered
by the SDR at Qualified if structural complexity is identified, but it is not
the default.

Routing decision point: at the Qualified stage, the SDR sets `Offer Path` =
Diagnostic or Consultation based on lead type. Inbound content leads may be
pre-routed to Diagnostic via form logic before reaching the SDR.

## Lead Magnet

One lead magnet. Sole conversion asset for this funnel.

**Corporate Health Check Checklist** — a 25-point scorecard organized across
the five health check pillars. Operator confronts their gaps line by line;
"Not sure" answers surface the liability; the gap bridges to the health check
purchase. Accessible directly from blog posts and the pillar page. Gate
mechanic (Option A vs B) pending ML1 decision.

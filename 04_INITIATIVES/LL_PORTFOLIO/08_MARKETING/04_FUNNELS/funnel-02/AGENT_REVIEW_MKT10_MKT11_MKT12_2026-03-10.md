# Funnel 02 Review — MKT Agents 10-12

## Scope
Review executed across:
- Messaging and narrative quality (`MKT_SOCIAL_NARRATIVE_AGENT`)
- Funnel structure and conversion architecture (`MKT_OFFER_FUNNEL_AGENT`)
- Competitive positioning and differentiation (`MKT_COMPETITIVE_POSITIONING_AGENT`)

Artifacts reviewed:
- `FUNNEL_SPEC.md`
- `funnel.yaml`
- `positioning.yaml`
- `target.yaml`
- `traffic.yaml`
- `intake.yaml`
- `pipeline.yaml`
- `metrics.yaml`
- `funnel2_leadmagnet_v2.md`
- `funnel2_blog_backlog.md`

## A. MKT-10 Social Narrative Review (Message)

### Strengths
- Message framing is strong: preventative, maturity-led, non-alarmist.
- Tone aligns with target buyer ethos (commercial, calm, structured).
- Narrative bridge to paid diagnostic is clear.

### Findings
1. **Top-of-funnel narrative is too dense for first contact**
- `funnel2_leadmagnet_v2.md` leads with long institutional framing before immediate business pain/outcome.
- Risk: drop-off before value is clear.

2. **CTA clarity is under-specified at message level**
- Core messaging does not consistently end with one explicit next action per asset variant.
- Risk: strong content, weak movement to conversion event.

3. **Offer naming drift across assets**
- Names vary: "Ontario Corporate Health Check", "Corporate Health Check", and multiple product-name options.
- Risk: brand memory fragmentation and weaker recall.

4. **Public-facing legal footer is missing in message artifacts**
- Current lead magnet drafts do not include the required informational disclaimer block.

### Recommendation
- Repackage lead magnet narrative into a layered format:
  - 30-second executive premise
  - 3 structural risks
  - 1 clear CTA to paid diagnostic
- Standardize one entry-offer name across all funnel assets.

## B. MKT-11 Offer/Funnel Review (Structure)

### Strengths
- ICP filters are clear and commercially serious.
- Qualification gates are explicit and align with paid-diagnostic model.
- Pipeline includes monetizable progression (diagnostic -> remediation -> retainer).

### Findings
1. **Metadata mismatch in canonical funnel file**
- `funnel.yaml` shows `id: funnel-02` but `name: Funnel 01 Future State`.
- Risk: operational ambiguity and reporting confusion.

2. **Lifecycle boundary is not explicit in pipeline ownership**
- Pipeline includes post-conversion delivery stages (`review_in_progress`, `delivery_meeting`, `remediation_project`, `fractional_counsel_retainer`) without ownership boundary labels.
- Risk: marketing vs fulfillment scope drift.

3. **Metrics are defined but not operationalized**
- `metrics.yaml` lists metrics but no target values, baseline windows, or stage SLAs.
- Risk: no enforceable performance accountability.

4. **README remains a stub**
- `README.md` is still TBD and non-operational.
- Risk: weak handoff for operators and agents.

### Recommendation
- Add explicit stage ownership labels in pipeline:
  - marketing-owned
  - shared handoff
  - fulfillment-owned
- Set target values and baselines for primary metrics.
- Replace funnel README stub with an operational brief.

## C. MKT-12 Competitive Positioning Review

### Strengths
- Positioning is coherent for a disciplined, prevention-first buyer.
- Clear exclusion logic protects against low-fit intake.
- Paid diagnostic framing differentiates from free consult competitors.

### Findings
1. **Differentiation is strong conceptually but weakly codified against alternatives**
- No explicit competitor/alternative comparison model is stored in funnel artifacts.
- Risk: team can articulate value internally but inconsistently in market-facing copy.

2. **Category stack needs tighter hierarchy**
- Funnel references both "Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service" and paid diagnostic entry product.
- Risk: category confusion at awareness stage.

3. **Proof architecture is thin**
- Positioning relies on logic and framing; fewer embedded proof devices (diagnostic outputs, before/after structure evidence, process transparency).
- Risk: slower trust transfer for skeptical buyers.

### Recommendation
- Add a codified competitive framing sheet with:
  - Alternative options buyers consider
  - Why those options fail at Stage 3-4
  - Why this funnel path is structurally superior
- Define one canonical category message by funnel stage.

## Priority Actions (Next 7 Days)

1. Fix canonical metadata and naming consistency.
2. Publish a non-stub Funnel 02 README with stage ownership boundaries.
3. Finalize metric targets for:
- `paid_health_check_conversion_rate`
- `remediation_project_conversion_rate`
- `retainer_conversion_rate`
4. Create one-page competitive differentiation matrix.
5. Refactor lead magnet opening into executive-first format and add required legal disclaimer.

## Preliminary Decision
Funnel 02 positioning is strategically strong and commercially viable.
Current bottlenecks are execution architecture and message-to-conversion clarity, not core strategy.

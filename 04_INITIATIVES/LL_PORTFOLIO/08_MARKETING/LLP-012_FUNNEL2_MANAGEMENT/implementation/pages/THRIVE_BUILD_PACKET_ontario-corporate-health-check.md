## Palette Reference (POL-049 Present State — Active)

All color values in this packet map to the POL-049 active palette.

| Token used in this packet | Hex value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| NAVY | `#1D4771` | Primary dark background (sections 1, 2, 4, 6, 10) |
| BLUE | `#0365B2` | Accent, button hover, card accent border |
| WHITE | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark, card backgrounds, section backgrounds |

| LIGHT-GRAY | `#D1D5DB` | Dividers, subtle borders, secondary text on white |
| BLACK | `#000000` | Body text on white backgrounds |

PALETTE FLAG FOR ML1: The reference pages at law.levinelegal.ca and
levinelegal.ca/corporate-law-firm/ use `#031b33` (very dark navy) and `#2f7ece`
(blue accent). These are outside the POL-049 active palette. This packet uses
the compliant equivalents `#1D4771` and `#0365B2`. If ML1 wishes to match the
reference pages exactly, an explicit palette exception approval is required
before execution.

## Thrive Leads Form Setup (Complete Before Building Hero)

The hero section requires a Thrive Leads form embedded in a Lead Generation

during the hero build.

2. Click "Add New" under Lead Groups (or use a standalone Shortcode form)
3. Select form type: Shortcode (so it can be embedded in Thrive Architect)
4. Name the form: `Health Check Hero Form`
5. Click "Add new design" and select the 2-step or inline form template
6. Edit the form fields:

   Field 1:
   - Type: Text
   - Label: First Name
   - Placeholder: First Name
   - Required: Yes

   Field 2:
   - Type: Text
   - Label: Last Name

   you page at `/health-check-thank-you/`) OR display a success message:
   "Thank you. We will be in touch within one business day."
8. Connect to GHL (Go High Level) via the Thrive Leads > API Connections
   settings. Tag the lead: `Health-Check-Request`, Funnel 2.

## Symbol Definitions

### SYMBOL: Site Header (Sticky Nav)
Name in Thrive: `LL-HEADER-STICKY`

If this Symbol already exists on the site, reuse it. If not, create it now.

Symbol structure:

Content Box element (outermost wrapper):
- Background: NAVY `#1D4771`
- Padding: top 0 / bottom 0 / left 0 / right 0
- Width: 100%
- Position: This box is the Symbol container; sticky behavior is set on
  the Thrive Template (Header template), not inside the Symbol itself.
  If building this as a standalone page (not via Thrive Theme Builder
  header template), use the Thrive Architect "Sticky" option on this
  Content Box: enable sticky, offset 0px, sticky background NAVY `#1D4771`.

  Inside the Content Box:
  Columns element: 2 columns, 30/70 split, vertical-align: center
  Padding on the Columns row: top 14px / bottom 14px / left 4% / right 4%

    Column 1 (Logo):
      Image element:
      - Source: Levine Law logo asset (upload from Canva export, white version
        for use on dark background)
      - Alt text: Levine Law — Ontario Corporate Lawyers
      - Max-width: 160px
      - Alignment: left
      - Link: `https://levine-law.ca/`

    Column 2 (Nav + CTA):
      Columns element: 2 columns, 75/25 split, vertical-align: center

        Inner Column 1 (Nav links):
          Text element (inline nav — or use WordPress Menu widget if available):
          Render the following as a horizontal link row.
          If Thrive Architect does not support inline menu natively, use a
          Custom HTML element with the following structure:

          ```html
          <nav class="ll-sticky-nav">
            <a href="#why-it-works">Why It Works</a>
            <a href="#what-you-get">What You Get</a>
            <a href="#about">About</a>
            <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a>
          </nav>
          ```

          Custom CSS class on the Custom HTML element: `ll-sticky-nav`
          (CSS defined in the Custom CSS block at the end of this packet)

        Inner Column 2 (CTA + Phone):
          Button element:
          - Label: Book Your Health Check
          - Link: anchor `#hero-form` (smooth scroll to hero form)
          - Background: BLUE `#0365B2`
          - Text: WHITE, Roboto Bold, 13px, uppercase
          - Padding: 10px 18px
          - Border-radius: 4px
          - Hover background: `#024f8a` (darkened BLUE — flag if ML1 wants
            exact hover color defined; this is 15% darker than `#0365B2`)

          Text element (phone):
          - Content: 365-599-0078
          - Link: `tel:3655990078`
          - Font: Roboto, 13px, WHITE `#FFFFFF`
          - Alignment: center
          - Margin-top: 4px

Symbol assignment:
- Assign to this page's top position before Section 2 hero.
- If Thrive Theme Builder header template is in use site-wide, assign this
  Symbol to the header template region instead.
- Update behavior: Changes to this Symbol propagate to all pages where it
  is assigned.

---

## Section-by-Section Build Instructions

---

### SECTION 1 — STICKY NAV

This section is the Symbol defined above (LL-HEADER-STICKY).

Implementation:
- If using Thrive Theme Builder: the Symbol is already in the header template;
  no separate section needed on this page.
- If building as a standalone page: insert a Content Box element at the very
  top of the page, make it sticky, and place the LL-HEADER-STICKY Symbol
  inside it.

Responsive behavior:
- At 768px breakpoint: hide the nav link row. Show hamburger icon.
  Thrive does not have a native mobile hamburger for inline nav built in
  Architect (it does in Theme Builder header templates). If this is a
  standalone Architect page (not using Theme Builder), use the Thrive
  Mobile Visibility toggles to hide the nav text at mobile and display a
  simplified nav with just the CTA button and phone number stacked.
- At 480px: CTA button full-width, phone centered below.

---

### SECTION 2 — HERO

[SECTION ID: hero]

Thrive custom CSS class on section: `ll-section-hero`

Outer Content Box:
- Background color: NAVY `#1D4771`
- Padding: top 80px / bottom 80px / left 5% / right 5%
- Width: 100%
- Anchor/ID: `hero-form` (set via Thrive element ID field so the nav CTA
  button scrolls here)

Inside the outer Content Box, insert:
Columns element: 2 columns, 55/45 split, vertical-align: top, gap: 48px

  --- Column 1 (Left — Headline + Value Proposition) ---

  Heading element:
  - Tag: H1
  - Text: The Ontario Corporate Health Check
  - Font: Roboto

  - Line-height: 1.6
  - Margin-bottom: 32px

  Divider element:
  - Style: solid line
  - Color: BLUE `#0365B2`
  - Width: 60px
  - Align: left
  - Height: 3px
  - Margin-bottom: 28px

  Styled List element (3 value bullets):

    color BLUE `#0365B2`, size 18px)

  - Text color: WHITE `#FFFFFF`
  - Line-height: 1.6

    structure, commercial contracts, and transaction readiness assessed in
    one structured engagement.

  Item 2:
    Icon: checkmark, BLUE `#0365B2`
    Bold label: Written Findings Report

    Bold label: Prioritized Action Plan
    Body text: — A sequenced remediation roadmap organized by risk level
    and business impact.

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTE FOR STYLED LIST BOLD LABELS: Thrive's Styled List
  element does not natively support mixed bold/regular text within one list
  item. Use a Custom HTML element instead of a Styled List element for these
  three bullets. Custom HTML structure:

  ```html
  <ul class="ll-value-bullets">
    <li>
      <span class="ll-bullet-label">Five-Pillar Review</span>
      — Shareholder agreements, corporate records, employment structure,
      commercial contracts, and transaction readiness assessed in one
      structured engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="ll-bullet-label">Written Findings Report</span>
      — Clear documentation of what is aligned, what has drifted, and
      where exposure exists.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="ll-bullet-label">Prioritized Action Plan</span>
      — A sequenced remediation roadmap organized by risk level and
      business impact.
    </li>
  </ul>
  ```

  of this packet under `.ll-value-bullets`.

  - Text: WHITE `#FFFFFF`, Roboto Bold, 16px, uppercase
  - Padding: 16px 36px
  - Border-radius: 4px
  - Hover background: `#024f8a`

  - Alignment: left

  - Border-radius: 8px
  - Padding: top 32px / bottom 32px / left 32px / right 32px
  - Box-shadow: `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.22)`

    Heading element (form title):
    - Tag: H3
    - Text: Request Your Health Check
    - Font: Roboto
    - Weight: 700
    - Size: 22px
    - Color: NAVY `#1D4771`
    - Alignment: center
    - Margin-bottom: 8px

    Text element (form subtitle):
    - Text: No obligation. We will review your intake and respond within
      one business day.
    - Font: Roboto
    - Size: 14px
    - Color: `#666666` (this is outside POL-049; use BLACK `#000000` at

      Flagged.)
    - Alignment: center
    - Margin-bottom: 24px

    Custom HTML element (Thrive Leads form embed):
    - Paste the Thrive Leads shortcode generated in the Form Setup section
      above: `[thrive_leads id='xxx']`
    - Thrive Architect will render the live form here.
    - If the shortcode does not render in preview, switch to the WordPress
      front-end preview mode to confirm rendering.

  FORM CARD COLOR FLAG: The form subtitle uses `#666666` which is not in
  the POL-049 palette. Use BLACK `#000000` at the minimum. ML1 to confirm
  preferred treatment for secondary text inside white cards.

Responsive behavior for Section 2:
- At 768px: Columns element stacks to single column. Column 2 (form card)
  moves ABOVE Column 1 on mobile (set Column 2 as "first" in mobile order
  via Thrive Architect responsive column order setting). This is standard
  practice for hero forms — form visible immediately on mobile without
  scrolling.

      Structure

    - Color: BLUE `#0365B2`
    - Width: 60px
    - Height: 3px
    - Align: center
    - Margin-bottom: 32px

    Text element:
    - Text: When a business incorporates, the documents reflect the company
      at that moment. As the business grows — adding shareholders,
      delegating authority, signing contracts, considering financing — the
      legal structure rarely keeps pace. The documents don't update
      themselves. The gap between what the structure says and how the
      business actually operates is where problems begin. Most companies
      discover this gap at the worst possible time: during a dispute, a
      financing process, or a transaction.
    - Font: Roboto
    - Size: 18px
    - Color: BLACK `#000000`

LAYOUT NOTE: Thrive Architect does not natively support a 5-card layout
with a top row of 3 and a bottom row of 2 centered. The two-row approach
above (first Columns = 3 cols, second Columns = 2 cols centered to 800px)
achieves this. Ensure the second Columns element's container is centered
using Thrive's "Center" alignment option.

Responsive behavior for Section 4:
- At 768px: first Columns element stacks to 1 column (cards full width,
  stacked). Second Columns element also stacks to 1 column.
- Card padding: 20px at 768px
- H2 font-size: 28px at 768px / 24px at 480px
- H3 inside cards: 17px at 768px
- Padding on outer Content Box: top 60px / bottom 60px / left 4% / right 4%
  at 768px

Outer Content Box:
- Background color: WHITE `#FFFFFF`
- Padding: top 80px / bottom 80px / left 10% / right 10%
- Width: 100%

  Heading element:
  - Tag: H2
  - Text: FAQs
  - Font: Roboto Bold, 40px
  - Color: NAVY `#1D4771`
  - Alignment: center
  - Margin-bottom: 12px

  Divider element:
  - Solid, BLUE `#0365B2`, 60px, 3px, centered
  - Margin-bottom: 48px

  Content Box element (accordion wrapper, max-width 820px, centered):

    Toggle (Accordion) element — FAQ 1:
    - Default state: Closed
    - Allow multiple open: No (only one open at a time)
    - Heading text: What is the Ontario Corporate Health Check?
    - Heading font: Roboto Bold, 17px, NAVY `#1D4771`
    - Heading background: WHITE `#FFFFFF`
    - Heading padding: 20px 24px
    - Heading border-bottom: 1px solid LIGHT-GRAY `#D1D5DB`
    - Open/close icon: Thrive default chevron, BLUE `#0365B2`, right-aligned
    - Body content: Text element inside accordion body:
        A structured legal review of your company's governance and
        commercial structure. We examine five areas — shareholder agreements,
        corporate records, employment, commercial contracts, and transaction
        readiness — and deliver a written findings report with a prioritized
        action plan.
      Font: Roboto, 16px, BLACK `#000000`, line-height 1.8
      Body padding: 20px 24px
      Body background: `#F9FAFB` (very light gray — see palette flag above;
      use WHITE `#FFFFFF` for strict compliance)

    Toggle (Accordion) element — FAQ 2:
    - (same configuration)
    - Heading text: Who is it for?
    - Body text: Ontario businesses with $1M–$8M in revenue, typically with
      5–30 employees, that have been operating for several years and want to
      understand whether their legal structure still reflects how the
      business actually works.

    Toggle (Accordion) element — FAQ 3:
    - (same configuration)
    - Heading text: What do I receive at the end?
    - Body text: A written findings report documenting alignment, gaps, and
      exposures across the five pillars — plus a prioritized action plan
      organized by risk level and business impact.

    Toggle (Accordion) element — FAQ 4:
    - (same configuration)
    - Heading text: How is this different from a free consultation?
    - Body text: A free consultation is a conversation. The Health Check is
      a structured engagement that produces written deliverables. It is
      designed for business owners who want a documented baseline, not a
      general discussion.

    Toggle (Accordion) element — FAQ 5:
    - (same configuration)
    - Heading text: What happens after the Health Check?
    - Body text: If issues are identified, you have the option to engage
      Levine Law to address them. The Health Check is not a sales pitch —
      it is a diagnostic. What you do with the findings is your decision.

  THRIVE ACCORDION CONFIGURATION NOTE: In Thrive Architect, the Toggle
  element is found under the "Advanced" or "Complex" element group. Each
  Toggle is inserted as a separate element — they are not automatically
  linked as an accordion group. To achieve "only one open at a time"
  behavior, wrap all five Toggle elements inside a single Thrive Tabs
  element (FAQ-style layout) OR accept that multiple can be open. If ML1
  wants true single-open accordion behavior, the cleanest approach is to
  use a Custom HTML element with a lightweight vanilla JS accordion.
  Custom HTML accordion code is provided at the end of this packet.
  Recommended: use the Custom HTML accordion approach for FAQ section.

Responsive behavior for Section 9:
- At 768px: left/right padding 4%
- H2: 28px at 768px
- Accordion heading font: 15px at 768px

## Custom HTML — FAQ Accordion (Replace Thrive Toggle Elements)

If ML1 chooses the Custom HTML accordion approach for Section 9 FAQs
(recommended for true single-open behavior), replace the five Toggle
elements in Section 9 with a single Custom HTML element containing the
following HTML. The CSS above handles all styling.

```html
<div class="ll-faq-accordion">

  <div class="ll-faq-item">
    <button class="ll-faq-question">
      What is the Ontario Corporate Health Check?
      <span class="ll-faq-icon">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="ll-faq-answer">
      A structured legal review of your company's governance and commercial
      structure. We examine five areas — shareholder agreements, corporate
      records, employment, commercial contracts, and transaction readiness —
      and deliver a written findings report with a prioritized action plan.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ll-faq-item">
    <button class="ll-faq-question">
      Who is it for?
      <span class="ll-faq-icon">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="ll-faq-answer">
      Ontario businesses with $1M–$8M in revenue, typically with 5–30
      employees, that have been operating for several years and want to
      understand whether their legal structure still reflects how the
      business actually works.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ll-faq-item">
    <button class="ll-faq-question">
      What do I receive at the end?
      <span class="ll-faq-icon">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="ll-faq-answer">
      A written findings report documenting alignment, gaps, and exposures
      across the five pillars — plus a prioritized action plan organized by
      risk level and business impact.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ll-faq-item">
    <button class="ll-faq-question">
      How is this different from a free consultation?
      <span class="ll-faq-icon">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="ll-faq-answer">
      A free consultation is a conversation. The Health Check is a structured
      engagement that produces written deliverables. It is designed for
      business owners who want a documented baseline, not a general discussion.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ll-faq-item">
    <button class="ll-faq-question">
      What happens after the Health Check?
      <span class="ll-faq-icon">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="ll-faq-answer">
      If issues are identified, you have the option to engage Levine Law to
      address them. The Health Check is not a sales pitch — it is a
      diagnostic. What you do with the findings is your decision.
    </div>
  </div>

</div>

<script>
(function() {
  var items = document.querySelectorAll('.ll-faq-item');
  items.forEach(function(item) {
    var btn = item.querySelector('.ll-faq-question');
    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
      var isOpen = item.classList.contains('open');
      // close all
      items.forEach(function(i) { i.classList.remove('open'); });
      // open this one if it was closed
      if (!isOpen) { item.classList.add('open'); }
    });
  });
})();
</script>
```

NOTE: Thrive Architect's Custom HTML element renders script tags. The
inline script above uses an IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression)
to avoid global scope pollution. Test after publishing in a staging
environment to confirm the accordion fires correctly before live deployment.

## Build Sequence Recommendation for ML1

Execute in this order to avoid dependency issues:

1. Create the WordPress page (title, slug, parent, template, Draft status).
2. Set up the Thrive Leads form (Health Check Hero Form) and note the
   shortcode ID before opening Thrive Architect.
3. Create or locate the LL-HEADER-STICKY Symbol and LL-FOOTER Symbol.
4. Open the page in Thrive Architect.
5. Insert Section 1 (nav Symbol or sticky header).
6. Build Section 2 (hero) — paste the Thrive Leads shortcode into the
   Custom HTML element in Column 2.
7. Build Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in order.
8. Build Section 8 (testimonials) — have approved testimonial copy ready.
9. Build Section 9 (FAQs) using the Custom HTML accordion block.
10. Build Section 10 (bottom CTA).
11. Insert footer Symbol.
12. Enter Custom CSS in the page-level Custom CSS tab.
13. Switch to responsive preview (768px and 480px) and verify all
    column stacking and font sizes. Apply per-element responsive overrides
    as needed.
14. Set Yoast SEO fields.
15. Save. Leave as Draft.
16. Share preview link with ML1 for review.

## Outstanding Items Flagged for ML1 Decision

1. PALETTE: Reference pages use `#031b33` and `#2f7ece`. This packet uses
   POL-049 compliant equivalents. ML1 must decide: use compliant palette
   OR approve explicit exception to match reference pages.

2. TESTIMONIALS: Exact testimonial copy not provided in brief. ML1 must
   supply the 4 approved testimonials before Section 8 is complete.

3. BIO COPY: Exact bio copy from reference page not provided. ML1 must
   paste approved bio copy into Section 7 Text element.

4. FORM COLOR — SUBTITLE: Form card subtitle uses text color `#666666`
   which is not in the active POL-049 palette. Use BLACK `#000000` unless
   ML1 approves an exception.

5. TESTIMONIAL BACKGROUND: Sections 8 and FAQ body use a light gray
   (`#F4F6F9` / `#F9FAFB`) outside the active palette. Use WHITE
   `#FFFFFF` for strict compliance, or ML1 to approve exception.

6. MENU PLACEMENT: This is a Level 3 conversion page per POL-051. Whether
   to include it in main site navigation is an ML1 decision. The page slug
   and parent page are set; menu item should only be added on ML1
   instruction.

7. FOOTER COPY: Footer column 1 tagline, contact email, and privacy/terms
   URLs are placeholders. ML1 to confirm from reference page.

8. WHY LEVINE LAW TILE COPY: Tile body descriptions in Section 6 are
   inferred from the offer. ML1 to confirm or substitute approved copy
   from the reference page.

9. THRIVE LEADS > GHL CONNECTION: The form must be connected to Go High
   Level via Thrive Leads API Connections before the page is live. ML1
   to verify the GHL integration is active and the correct pipeline and
   tag are applied.

10. THANK YOU PAGE: A `/health-check-thank-you/` redirect page is needed
    as the form success destination. This page is not in scope for this
    packet but must be created before the form goes live.

## ML1 Publish Step

This page is a Draft. To publish:
1. Open the page in WordPress > Thrive Architect.
2. Review all sections end-to-end in desktop and mobile preview.
3. Confirm all Outstanding Items above are resolved.
4. Confirm Thrive Leads form is connected to GHL.
5. Confirm all internal links and anchor scrolls work.
6. Verify Yoast SEO fields are complete.
7. Change page Status from Draft to Published.
8. Add menu item to the correct WordPress menu location and position
   per ML1 instruction.
9. Test form submission end-to-end (submit a test lead and confirm it
   appears in GHL with the correct tag and pipeline).

INV-0002 applies: ML1 must execute all publish actions. No autonomous
publish by the system.

# Marketing Strategy

## Strategy Thesis

- Funnel 01 is a temporary reactive acquisition channel.
- Funnel 02 is the intended structural replacement: paid diagnostic, higher-quality clients, lower noise, greater strategic leverage.
- Funnel 03 builds vertical authority in regulated payments space.

## Channel Strategy

- Do:
  - Google Ads for reactive acquisition (Funnel 01)
  - Content + lead magnets for preventative acquisition (Funnel 02)
  - Authority-building content for payments/MSB counsel (Funnel 03)
- Do Not:
  - Crisis-driven or panic-based messaging
  - Free consultation positioning as the primary entry point

## Offer Mapping

| Funnel | Entry Offer | Core Offer |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| F01 | Fractional Counsel consult | Ongoing retainer |
| F02 | Paid Corporate Health Check | Remediation + Fractional Counsel |
| F03 | MSB/AML entry services | Ongoing AML Counsel |

## Funnel Portfolio Intent

- F01 sustains qualified intake while transition to preventative positioning is built.
- F02 becomes the primary corporate entry path through paid diagnostics.
- F03 grows vertical authority and conversion for payments regulatory work.

## Constraints

- Capacity: prioritize maturity-gated, qualified intake only
- Compliance: marketing does not provide legal advice or accept matters autonomously
- Tone: calm authority, preventative, operator-aligned
- Risk: avoid crisis-only engagements and litigation-driven intake

## Operating Cadence

- Review rhythm: TBD

## Governance Rules

- No new funnel may be created without: defined ICP, defined entry offer, defined measurable KPIs, and upstream objective mapping.
- Funnel KPI targets must map to 02_GOALS/ goals files.
- Funnels must reference Positioning, Objectives, and Goals explicitly.

## Marketing Architecture

Positioning -> Objectives -> Goals -> Strategy -> Funnels

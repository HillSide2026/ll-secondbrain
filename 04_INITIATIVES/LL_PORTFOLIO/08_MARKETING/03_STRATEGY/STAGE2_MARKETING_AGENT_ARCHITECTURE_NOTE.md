# Stage 2 Marketing Agent Architecture (Non-Authoritative Note)

This note captures a working architecture proposal for Stage 2 marketing agents.

It does not override existing positioning, objectives, strategy, funnels, or governance artifacts.

---

## High-Level System Map

Stage Doctrine (Positioning + Objectives + Strategy)
  -> Selective Provocation Engine  -> Attention Signals
  -> Blog & SEO Engine             -> Authority Assets
  -> SEO & Metrics Master          -> Performance Intelligence
  -> Conversion Architect          -> Economic Optimization
  -> Strategic Editor              -> Coherence Gate
  -> Approved System State Update

The Strategic Editor is the final gate, not the starting point.

---

## Agent Roles (Summary)

### 1) Selective Provocation Engine

Role: Tension Generator (Top-of-Funnel Attention)

Function:
- Create high-signal hooks
- Filter ICP early
- Generate engagement from operators

Feeds:
- Blog & SEO Engine (expands strong hooks)
- SEO & Metrics Master (engagement data)

Does NOT:
- Optimize
- Redefine positioning
- Change offers

---

### 2) Blog & SEO Engine

Role: Authority Builder

Function:
- Expand hooks into structured long-form content
- Build keyword clusters
- Support Funnel 02 primarily
- Support Funnel 03 secondarily

Feeds:
- SEO & Metrics Master (performance data)
- Conversion Architect (behavioral data from CTA interaction)

Does NOT:
- Decide what converts
- Change landing pages
- Adjust ICP

---

### 3) SEO & Metrics Master

Role: Intelligence Layer

Function:
- Monitor impressions, CTR, time-on-page
- Track lead magnet downloads
- Identify keyword gaps
- Detect funnel drop-off
- Flag underperforming assets

Feeds:
- Conversion Architect (conversion bottlenecks)
- Content Creator (content gap recommendations)
- Strategic Editor (performance summary)

Does NOT:
- Change messaging
- Rewrite content
- Redefine goals

---

### 4) Conversion Architect

Role: Economic Optimizer

Function:
- Identify diagnostic purchase friction
- Improve landing page conversion
- Improve retainer conversion
- Refine CTA framing
- Adjust sequencing

Feeds:
- Strategic Editor (proposed changes)
- Blog & SEO Engine (content adjustments needed)
- Selective Provocation (if upstream signal weak)

Does NOT:
- Increase volume at cost of ICP
- Remove structural gating

---

### 5) Strategic Editor

Role: Coherence Authority

Reviews:
- Hook tone
- Content alignment
- SEO targeting
- Conversion changes
- KPI incentives

Ensures:
- Stage 2 discipline maintained
- No regression to reactive identity
- No authority dilution
- No metric-driven drift

Final decision maker before implementation.

---

## Structural Layers

Layer 1 — Attention & Authority
- Selective Provocation Engine
- Blog & SEO Engine

Layer 2 — Intelligence & Economics
- SEO & Metrics Master
- Conversion Architect

Layer 3 — Governance
- Strategic Editor

---

## Information Flow Model

Flow is circular, not linear:

Hooks -> Content -> Traffic -> Data -> Conversion Insights -> Strategic Review -> Refined Hooks -> Refined Content -> Better Traffic -> Better Conversions

---

## Authority Hierarchy (Critical)

When agents conflict:
- Strategic Editor has override authority
- Positioning overrides metrics
- ICP quality overrides volume
- Stage discipline overrides short-term optimization

---

## Activation Phases

### Phase 1 — Signal & Authority (Weeks 0-4)

Activate:
- Selective Provocation Engine
- Blog & SEO Engine

Keep others in observational mode.

Purpose:
- Establish signal
- Build content inventory
- Generate measurable attention
- Collect baseline engagement data

No aggressive optimization yet.

### Phase 2 — Intelligence Layer (Weeks 4-8)

Activate:
- SEO & Metrics Master

Purpose:
- Identify high-performing hooks
- Identify weak CTAs
- Detect ICP drift
- See which topics convert to diagnostic interest

### Phase 3 — Economic Engine (Weeks 8-12)

Activate:
- Conversion Architect

Only once you have:
- Content volume
- Traffic consistency
- Baseline conversion data

Then optimize:
- Diagnostic purchase rate
- Email sequencing
- Intake friction
- Proposal conversion

### Phase 4 — Governance Lock (Immediate, Lightweight)

Strategic Editor exists from Day 1 in lightweight mode, scaling to full governance as content volume grows.

---

## Orchestration Rationale

If you start optimizing before signal, you optimize noise.
If you govern too tightly too early, you choke experimentation.
If you create content without measurement, you drift.

---

## Clean Activation Map

Month 1:
- Provocation + Blog (Editor light)

Month 2:
- Add Metrics (Editor moderate)

Month 3:
- Add Conversion Architect (Editor full)

Continuous:
- Positioning discipline

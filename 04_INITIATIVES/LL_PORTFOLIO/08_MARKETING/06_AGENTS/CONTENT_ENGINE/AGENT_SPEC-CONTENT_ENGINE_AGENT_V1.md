## 5) Output Structure

Nightly batch generation:

Create:
- `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/06_AGENTS/CONTENT_ENGINE/OUTPUT/YYYY-MM-DD/`

Each batch must include:
- 3 Funnel 02 posts
- 3 Funnel 03 posts
- 1 long-form outline (blog or LinkedIn article)
- Suggested CTA alignment
- Suggested funnel mapping

Each post file must include a metadata header:
- POST_ID
- FUNNEL: 02 or 03
- OBJECTIVE: OBJ-01 / OBJ-02 / OBJ-03
- ICP
- STAGE: Awareness / Consideration / Diagnostic / Conversion
- CTA
- STATUS: Draft

---

## 6) Content Guardrails

The agent must NOT:
- Target pre-revenue startups
- Invite crisis clients
- Offer litigation services
- Promise outcomes
- Provide legal advice specific to a fact pattern
- Drift outside Ontario (for Funnel 02)
- Drift outside Canada exposure (for Funnel 03)

If prompts conflict with positioning, abort generation.

---

## 7) Operating Modes

Mode 1: Draft Mode (Default)
- Generate content
- Save to OUTPUT/
- Await human approval

Mode 2: Scheduled Mode (Only if ML1 authorizes)
- Generate
- Push to scheduling queue (no autopublish unless approved)

---

## 8) Quality Filter Layer

Before saving output, check:
- ICP matches Positioning
- CTA matches funnel spec
- Tone aligns with structural counsel positioning
- Authority-building, not generic
- Non-crisis orientation

If any fail, regenerate.

---

## 9) Metrics Integration

Each generated batch must log to:
- `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/05_ANALYTICS/CONTENT_LOG.md`

Log fields:
- Date
- Number of pieces generated
- Funnel alignment
- Intended KPI linkage

---

## 10) System Summary

Positioning
  -> Objectives
    -> Strategy
      -> Funnels
        -> Content Engine Agent

The agent serves Funnels. Funnels serve Strategy. Strategy serves Positioning.
The agent does not define positioning. It operationalizes it.

Title: If you cannot explain your governance structure in three minutes, you have a problem.

Operators do not need legal jargon. They need structural clarity. If a CEO or owner-operator cannot describe how decisions are made, how ownership rights work, and what happens if a partner exits, the governance system is not stable.

This is not a compliance concern. It is an operating risk. Growth-stage companies accumulate complexity fast. New hires, new capital, and new counterparties expose weak governance. The fix is not a patch. The fix is a structured review that maps how the legal system matches the operating system.

A clean governance system does three things:
- clarifies who decides and how
- protects the business from internal drift
- reduces friction when capital or partners come into the picture

If that is not true today, it is not a crisis. It is a maturity gap. Close it before it becomes a bottleneck.

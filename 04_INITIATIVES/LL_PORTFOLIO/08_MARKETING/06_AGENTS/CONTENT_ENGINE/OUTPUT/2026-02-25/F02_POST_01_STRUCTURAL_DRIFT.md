Title: Your company is growing. Your legal structure probably isn't.

Most Ontario operators fix legal structure after something breaks. That is reactive. Growth-stage operators need the opposite: structural clarity before compounding risk.

Here is the tell: if the business has grown beyond the assumptions embedded in its shareholder agreement, governance, or contractor stack, the company is already operating out of alignment. That misalignment does not show up as a crisis until it does. The objective is to identify structural drift early, while fixes are still simple and low-friction.

This is not about legal theory. It is about operational stability. Your documents are part of your operating system. If they do not reflect your current reality, you are exposed to avoidable bottlenecks later: financing delays, governance disputes, or unnecessary cleanups.

If the last time the structure was reviewed was at incorporation, it is time for a reset. The right diagnostic is not a random consult. It is a structured review that surfaces the gaps, prioritizes remediation, and aligns governance to current scale.

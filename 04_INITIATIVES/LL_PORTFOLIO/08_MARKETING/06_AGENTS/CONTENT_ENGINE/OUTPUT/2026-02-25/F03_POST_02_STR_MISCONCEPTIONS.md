Title: STR filings are not a paperwork problem. They are a systems problem.

Many payments teams treat STRs as isolated events. In reality, STR readiness is a system property. It depends on monitoring logic, escalation rules, decision authority, and documentation integrity.

If an STR is triggered but the business cannot clearly show why it filed or why it did not file, the program is not defensible. This is not about fear. It is about operational clarity and audit readiness.

AML systems should be designed for explainability. That requires documented logic, consistent monitoring, and a clear owner for escalation decisions.

If your program relies on ad hoc judgment without a structured audit trail, you have exposure.

CTA: Run an AML Health Check to assess STR readiness and program defensibility.

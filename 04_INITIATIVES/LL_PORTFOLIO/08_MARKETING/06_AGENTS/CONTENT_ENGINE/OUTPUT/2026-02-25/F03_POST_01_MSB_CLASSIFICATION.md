Title: MSB status is not a formality. It is a business model decision.

Payments operators often treat MSB registration as an administrative hurdle. In reality, MSB classification determines onboarding risk, banking access, compliance cost, and the viability of the launch sequence.

The question is not only whether registration is required. The question is whether the business model is designed for the regulatory perimeter it is entering. That is a structural decision, not a checklist.

A clean regulatory architecture aligns product design, custody flow, reporting obligations, and banking partner expectations. When those elements do not align, the company pays for it in delays, rework, or rejection.

If the launch plan assumes regulatory clarity without a documented perimeter decision, you are guessing. That is not defensible.

CTA: Request an MSB Registration assessment to clarify perimeter and sequencing.

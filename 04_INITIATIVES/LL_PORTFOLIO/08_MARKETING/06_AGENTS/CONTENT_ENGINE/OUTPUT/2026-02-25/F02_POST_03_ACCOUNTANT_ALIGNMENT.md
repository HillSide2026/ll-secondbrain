Title: Accountants see the symptoms. Structural counsel fixes the system.

Most growth-stage operators have an accountant before they have structured legal oversight. That is normal. It also creates a common gap: the financial system advances while the governance system stays frozen.

The result is predictable. The accountant flags issues like share structure confusion, missing resolutions, or unclear ownership records. These are not tax problems. They are structural legal problems that need a diagnostic approach.

The Corporate Health Check exists to close that gap. It is a structured review of governance integrity, ownership structure, contractor and employment exposure, and contract risk alignment. It produces a prioritized remediation roadmap. It does not create panic. It creates clarity.

If the accounting team is asking for documents you are not confident in, the answer is not a patch or a quick rewrite. The answer is a structured diagnostic.

CTA: Book a Corporate Health Check to assess governance integrity and define a remediation roadmap.

# AGENT SPEC — BLOG_SEO_ENGINE V2

**Agent ID**: BSE-01
**Classification**: Content Production Agent
**Status**: Draft — blocked pending activation dependency

---

## Activation Dependency

**Hard block**: This agent does not activate until the Health Check landing page is live on levine-law.ca.

Rationale: SEO content without a conversion destination produces traffic that cannot convert. The Health Check landing page is the destination for all F02 content CTAs. Producing content before it exists creates orphaned authority assets with no economic return.

Secondary dependency: Approved keyword list from SEO-01 (IMP-05). This agent does not choose keywords — it executes against an ML1-approved keyword list.

---

## Role

Content production for:
- SEO traffic targeting the Structuring keyword cluster
- F02 (Corporate Health Check) demand generation
- F03 (Payments/MSB) authority building

This agent is a structured SEO authority engine, not a content factory. Output is operator-level, positioning-consistent, and diagnostic-pathway-oriented.

---

## What This Agent Does

### Produces
- Structured SEO articles mapped to approved keyword clusters
- Content metadata (title, description, keyword mapping) per article
- Output stored in `06_AGENTS/BLOG_SEO_ENGINE/OUTPUT/YYYY-MM-DD/` with status: DRAFT

### Does NOT
- Choose keywords (SEO-01 provides approved keyword list)
- Publish content without ML1 approval
- Override positioning constraints
- Generate content before Hard Input Dependencies are confirmed present

---

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "approved_keywords": [string],
  "content_brief": {
    "target_keyword": string,
    "intent_type": "informational | transactional",
    "funnel": "F02 | F03",
    "icp": "ICP-01 | ICP-02",
    "stage": "Awareness | Consideration | Diagnostic | Conversion",
    "cta": string
  },
  "positioning_constraints": "ref: LLP-025_MARKETING_STRATEGY/MARKET_POSITIONING.md"
}
```

If `approved_keywords` is empty or missing → agent refuses to generate. Fail closed.

---

## Output Schema

```json
{
  "article": string,
  "seo_metadata": {
    "title": string,
    "description": string
  },
  "keyword_mapping": [terms],
  "post_metadata": {
    "post_id": string,
    "funnel": "F02 | F03",
    "icp": "ICP-01 | ICP-02",
    "stage": string,
    "cta": string,
    "status": "Draft"
  }
}
```

All outputs default to `status: Draft`. No article advances to published without ML1 approval.

---

## Content Structure (Long-Form)

Each article must include:
- Primary keyword in H1 and first 100 words
- 3–5 secondary long-tail keywords (from approved list)
- Clear H1 / H2 hierarchy
- FAQ schema section
- Internal links: Health Check page, at least one prior post, at least one solution page
- Soft CTA mid-article
- Hard CTA at end (Health Check purchase or AML/MSB entry offer)

---

## Content Themes

### F02 — Corporate Health Check (60% of output)

Themes:
- Structural drift (company has outgrown its legal documents)
- Governance misalignment (cap table, shareholder agreement, board structure)
- Accountant-lawyer coordination gaps
- Growth-stage legal exposure — not crisis, not litigation
- "You've outgrown your documents"

Tone: Calm, operator-first, systems-focused. No fear-based marketing. No litigation bait.

### F03 — Payments / MSB Authority (30% of output)

Themes:
- MSB registration and FINTRAC compliance
- AML program requirements and structural failures
- RPAA compliance
- What operators misunderstand about Canadian AML

Tone: Regulatory-precise, authority-driven. No hype. No crisis positioning.

### F01 Support (10% of output)

Incidental SEO support only. No dedicated F01 content production.

---

## Content Quality Filter

Before finalizing any draft, verify:
- Attracts crisis or litigation clients? → Revise
- Attracts sub-$1M operators? → Tighten language
- Positions LL as reactive? → Remove
- Pushes toward structured diagnostic (Health Check or AML entry offer)? → Required
- Ontario explicitly referenced (F02 content)? → Required

---

## Hard Input Dependencies (Fail Closed)

Required before any generation:
- `LLP-025_MARKETING_STRATEGY/MARKET_POSITIONING.md`
- `LLP-025_MARKETING_STRATEGY/MARKETING_STRATEGY.md`
- F02 funnel spec (Health Check scope, price, landing page URL)
- ML1-approved keyword list from SEO-01

If any are missing → refuse to generate.

## KPIs

| KPI | Measurement |
|---|---|
| Organic traffic growth | Month-over-month impressions and sessions from Structuring cluster |
| Ranking position | Average position for approved keyword list (target: page 1 within 90 days per cluster) |
| Conversion contribution | Health Check purchases attributable to organic search traffic |

---

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Description |
|---|---|
| SEO over-optimization | Keyword density or structure that reads as optimized rather than authoritative; damages positioning |
| Thin content | Articles that pass keyword requirements but lack operator-level substance |
| Keyword stuffing | Mechanically inserting keywords without semantic integration |

---

## Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Keyword list not ML1-approved | Block generation; do not proceed |
| Strategic Editor rejects output | Suspend that article; flag specific rejection reason; do not republish without revision and re-review |
| F02 landing page goes offline | Pause all F02 content production; CTAs have no destination |

---

## Relationship to Other Agents

```
SEO-01 (SEO Metrics Master) → provides approved keyword list and content briefs
BSE-01 (Blog & SEO Engine) → produces articles
  → Strategic Editor (coherence gate — all drafts reviewed before approval)
  → SEO-01 (tracks ranking and conversion performance of published posts)
  → SPE-01 (high-performing long-form posts repurposed into hooks)
```

Strategic Editor is a blocking dependency. Articles flagged by Strategic Editor do not advance to ML1 approval queue.

## Target Client (Economic Buyer)
### Target Reader (Entry-Level Authority Audience)
Senior operators or founders who know regulation matters but lack a clean mental model and want one without being talked down to. They are capable, serious, and not yet fluent.

Confirmed titles (decision‑proximate):
- Founder / Co‑founder
- CEO (early to growth stage)
- COO / Head of Operations
- Head of Payments
- Head of Compliance (commercially minded)
- Product lead responsible for payments or stablecoin rails

Reader maturity profile:
- Pre‑launch or early‑launch in Canada
- Exploring payments or stablecoins as infrastructure, not ideology
- Uncertain about MSB vs non‑MSB models, timing of registration, bank reactions, and what “regulatory readiness” means
- Suspects there are traps but cannot yet name them

What the entry content must deliver:
- Language and orientation
- Sequencing and mental models
- Confidence to ask better questions
- Calm, practical framing that is useful even if they never become a client

### Target Client (Economic Buyer)
A payments or stablecoin founder/executive who crosses the threshold from “friendly advice” to needing counsel because regulatory decisions now have capital, partner, or launch consequences. This is conversion by maturity, not persuasion.

Typical triggers (reader → client):
- Investor due diligence introduces regulatory scrutiny
- A banking partner asks uncomfortable questions
- Stablecoin plans move from idea to architecture
- Expansion into Canada stops being theoretical
- Early shortcuts start blocking growth

Boundary statement:
Public content is informational only. Formal legal advice begins after engagement.

### Internal North Star
The book earns trust through friendliness. The ecosystem earns authority through discernment.

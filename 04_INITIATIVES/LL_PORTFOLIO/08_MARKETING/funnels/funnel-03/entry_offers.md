Why:

Do not price under $5k.

They want:
- Legitimacy

3. STR & Reporting Framework  
4. Ongoing AML Counsel Retainer

**Strategic Risk to Avoid**
- Free “Am I an MSB?” calls

## Entry 2: Suspicious Transaction Triage & STR Filing

**Strategic Positioning**
- Controlled regulatory response when a transaction crosses the line.
- Not panic response.
- Not crisis defence.
- Not “we’ll file something quickly.”
- Must feel structured and defensible.

**Who This Is For**
Canadian MSBs / PSPs who:
- Identified a suspicious transaction
- Are unsure whether threshold for STR is met
- Have never filed before
- Have filed but lack internal structure
- Want regulator-defensible documentation

They are thinking:
- “Does this meet reporting threshold?”
- “What if we fail to report?”
- “Are we over-reporting?”
- “Will this trigger scrutiny?”

They are not:
- Individuals reporting fraud
- Consumers
- Police-adjacent matters
- Litigation clients

**Core Framing**
This is not: “Help me fill out a form.”

It is: Regulatory threshold assessment and defensible reporting architecture.

The product must emphasize:
- Threshold analysis
- Documentation discipline
- Internal escalation clarity
- Future-proofing process

**Structure of the Offer**
Phase 1 – Fact Intake & Transaction Mapping
- Transaction details
- Customer profile
- Source of funds indicators
- Pattern review
- Geographic exposure
- Previous flags
- Deliverable: Structured transaction narrative

Phase 2 – Threshold Assessment
LL evaluates:
- Does this meet STR criteria?
- What factors elevate suspicion?
- Are there alternative reporting triggers?
- Is there pattern-based risk?

Important: Document the reasoning process. This becomes a compliance asset.

Phase 3 – STR Drafting & Submission Support
- Draft STR narrative
- Ensure clarity and completeness
- Ensure consistency with AML framework
- Provide submission guidance

Position this as careful, deliberate, defensible.

Phase 4 – Internal Control Debrief (Critical Add-On)
After filing, LL provides:
- What in your system allowed this to surface?
- Were detection triggers adequate?
- Is your monitoring sufficient?
- Do you need broader AML review?

This phase is where upsell happens.

**Deliverables**
1. Written threshold assessment summary
2. Draft STR narrative
3. Filing guidance
4. Internal control observations memo
5. Escalation protocol template (optional add-on)

This cannot feel rushed or reactive.

**Pricing Strategy**
- Suggested: $3,500–$7,500 per incident

Variables:
- Complexity
- Cross-border exposure
- Crypto involvement
- Volume of transactions

Do not price low. Urgency justifies premium.

**Conversion Path**
This entry offer naturally leads to:
- AML Health Check
- STR Playbook Implementation
- Quarterly AML Oversight Retainer
- Full AML Framework Rewrite

**Psychological Dynamics**
They are:
- Anxious, but not panicked
- Risk-aware
- Concerned about regulator scrutiny
- Concerned about documentation trail

Tone must be:
- Measured
- Non-dramatic
- Procedural
- Authoritative

Example positioning line:
“Suspicion is not the same as reportability. We assess threshold carefully and document the basis for your decision.”

**Intake Gate Logic**
Require:
- Registered MSB? (Yes/No)
- Volume of monthly transactions
- Industry type
- Cross-border activity?
- Crypto involvement?
- Have you filed STRs before?

Decline:
- Individuals

## Entry 3: AML Health Check (Canada)

**Strategic Role in Funnel 3**
If:
- Entry 1 = Regulatory Entry (MSB Registration)
- Entry 2 = Incident-Level Response (STR Triage)

Then:
- Entry 3 = Full Compliance Architecture Review

This is where serious operators realize: "Registration is not compliance."

**Who This Is For**
Canadian reporting entities that:
- Are already registered (or clearly required to be)
- Have an AML program in place
- Have grown since implementation
- Have filed STRs but lack internal confidence
- Are preparing for bank review, partner scrutiny, or FINTRAC exam
- Have not completed a proper two-year effectiveness review

They are thinking:
- "Is our AML program defensible?"
- "Would we survive a FINTRAC review?"
- "Our policies exist -- but are they aligned to how we actually operate?"
- "Are we missing reporting triggers?"

They are not:
- Pre-revenue startups
- Paper-only registration clients
- Casual crypto projects
- One-off form shoppers

Not a policy rewrite. They are buying:
- Audit defensibility
- Structural clarity

- Institutional credibility

They want: "If FINTRAC reviews us tomorrow, we are prepared."

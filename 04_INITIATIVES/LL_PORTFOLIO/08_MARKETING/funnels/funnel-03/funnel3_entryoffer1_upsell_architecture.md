# Entry Offer 1 Upsell Architecture

## Immediate Upsells (Natural Next Step)
These convert at the moment registration clarity is delivered.

### 1. AML Framework Design (TM)
**Hub:** Regulatory, Compliance and Securities

**When it triggers:**
- After MSB registration is confirmed or filed.

**Why it converts:**
- Registration requires a compliant AML program. Most founders underestimate this.

**Scope includes:**
- Full AML policy drafting
- Risk assessment framework
- KYC procedures
- STR escalation architecture
- Record-keeping design
- Training framework
- Independent review planning

**Psychological positioning:**
- "Registration is step one. Your AML program is what regulators examine."

### 2. Compliance Officer Structuring and Training (TM)
**When it triggers:**
- When founders say: "We'll just name someone internally."

**Scope includes:**
- Role clarification
- Written mandate
- Reporting lines
- Escalation design
- Personal liability awareness
- Board reporting structure

**Positioning:**
- "Appointment is easy. Accountability is not."

Strong governance credibility upsell.

## Short-Term Upsells (30 to 60 Days Post-Registration)
### 3. AML Health Check (TM)
Diagnostic review of:
- Policies
- Monitoring system
- STR logic

Perfect bridge into Entry Offer 2 (STR Triage).

### 4. Suspicious Transaction Triage and STR Filing (TM)
This becomes highly relevant once:

Position as operational governance, not crisis defense.

## Mid-Tier Recurring Revenue Upsells
These convert sophisticated operators.

### 5. Quarterly AML Oversight Retainer (TM)
**Scope:**

- STR spot-checking
- Escalation consultations
- Regulatory update briefings
- Board-ready summary memos

**Psychology:**
- They want defensibility and adult supervision.

### 6. Annual AML Program Independent Review Support

**Offer:**
- Mock examination
- Gap analysis
- Remediation roadmap

Strong authority builder.

## Governance and Structuring Cross-Sell (Hub 1)
After registration clarity, many founders realize corporate structure gaps.

### 7. Governance and Structuring Audit (TM)
- Share structure review
- Director designations

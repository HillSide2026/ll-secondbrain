# The Six Pillars of AML Defensibility

Each pillar reflects a structural component regulators evaluate during examinations.

## Pillar 1 - Risk Assessment Framework
A documented risk assessment is foundational.

Regulators examine whether:
- A formal risk assessment exists
- Risk categories reflect actual products and services
- Geographic exposure is evaluated
- High-risk customer types are defined
- Risk ratings align with real transaction patterns
- The assessment is periodically updated

**Structural Question**
Is your risk assessment a living governance document -- or a static template?

**What Mature Programs Demonstrate**
- Documented rationale for risk scoring
- Clear linkage between risk rating and monitoring intensity
- Evidence of periodic review
- Alignment between onboarding and transaction patterns

## Pillar 2 - Policies and Procedures
Policies must match operational reality.

Regulatory review focuses on:
- Whether procedures reflect actual workflows
- Clarity of escalation protocols
- Defined STR triggers
- Internal understanding of "reasonable grounds to suspect"
- Role clarity for compliance oversight

**Structural Question**
Do your written policies describe how your business actually operates?

## Pillar 3 - Transaction Monitoring and Detection
Detection architecture is often where structural gaps surface.

Examiners assess:
- Manual vs automated monitoring
- Documentation of alert logic
- Consistency of escalation decisions
- Recordkeeping of dismissed alerts
- Pattern recognition capabilities

**Structural Question**
If asked how a suspicious transaction was identified -- could your team articulate the process clearly?

## Pillar 4 - Reporting Discipline
STR filing is only one dimension of reporting compliance.

Regulatory scrutiny includes:
- Timeliness of filing
- Narrative quality and clarity
- Structured field accuracy
- Documentation of subsequent related transactions
- Five-year record retention compliance

**Text Box Insert: Over-Filing vs. Under-Filing**
Compliance maturity is not measured by volume of STRs filed.

Under-filing may create exposure if threshold is met but documentation is weak.

Over-filing may signal poor threshold calibration.

Regulators evaluate defensibility -- not filing frequency.

## Pillar 5 - Governance and Compliance Officer Structure
An AML program requires accountable oversight.

Review typically includes:
- Formal designation of Compliance Officer
- Clear reporting lines
- Evidence of leadership awareness
- Independence of review function
- Board-level documentation (if applicable)

**Structural Question**
Is the Compliance Officer empowered -- or merely appointed?

## Pillar 6 - Effectiveness Review and Testing
Canadian reporting entities must conduct a periodic effectiveness review (generally every two years).

Examiners may assess:
- Whether review occurred
- Scope of testing performed
- Documentation of findings
- Tracking of deficiencies
- Recorded remediation steps

**Text Box Insert: The Two-Year Effectiveness Review Requirement**
An AML program must not only exist -- it must be tested.

Where no documented review has been completed within the required period, regulators may question overall program governance.

Effectiveness review is not a formality. It is structural validation.

## AML Maturity Matrix (TM)
Across these six pillars, compliance programs typically fall into one of four tiers:

- Foundational: Policies exist but lack alignment
- Developing: Core structures in place, documentation gaps remain
- Structured: Clear processes with documented reasoning
- Regulator-Ready: Integrated governance, documented defensibility

Most growing MSBs fall between Developing and Structured.

## Signs a Structured Review May Be Warranted
Organizations often seek full architecture review where:
- Transaction volume has increased materially
- Crypto or cross-border exposure expanded
- STR filings have occurred but lack internal documentation discipline
- Banking partners request enhanced compliance evidence
- An effectiveness review has not been completed
- Policies have not been updated to reflect current operations

The objective is not alarm. It is calibration.

## Introducing: AML Health Check (TM) (Canada)
For reporting entities seeking structured evaluation, Levine Law provides a comprehensive compliance architecture review.

The AML Health Check (TM) is structured across the six pillars described above and delivers:

**What You Receive**
1. Executive Compliance Summary (8-12 Pages)
- Clear articulation of current compliance posture
- Identified structural gaps
- Severity categorization
- Regulatory risk tier
- Plain-language, governance-focused

2. AML Maturity Matrix (TM)
- Scored across: Risk Assessment, Policies and Procedures, Monitoring, Reporting, Governance, Effectiveness Testing
- Provides clarity on institutional positioning

3. Prioritized Remediation Roadmap
- Immediate (0-30 days)
- Near-Term (90 days)
- Strategic (6-12 months)
- Each recommendation includes: risk level, operational impact, estimated implementation scope

4. Optional Board-Ready Summary Slide
- For organizations with governance layers requiring oversight reporting

## Who This Is Designed For
- Registered Canadian reporting entities
- MSBs and PSPs experiencing growth
- Crypto-enabled platforms
- Cross-border operators
- Organizations preparing for bank or regulator review

This engagement is not designed for:
- Pre-revenue startups
- Paper-only registration clients
- Entities without an AML framework
- Casual projects

## Positioning Perspective
Your program may be compliant.

The question is whether it is defensible.

Compliance is about obligation.
Defensibility is about documentation, alignment, and governance clarity.

## Next Step
If your organization:
- Has an AML program in place
- Has grown since initial implementation
- Has not conducted a structured effectiveness review
- Wants confidence ahead of potential scrutiny

You may consider a structured AML Health Check (TM).

A no-obligation consultation call is available to assess engagement suitability.

## Closing Line
Registration begins the regulatory journey.
Architecture sustains it.
Defensibility protects it.

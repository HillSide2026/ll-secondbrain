# The Suspicious Transaction Report Wiki
## Recent Developments for Canadian MSBs and PSPs

## Introduction
Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) form a core component of Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA).

Reporting entities are required to file an STR where they determine, on reasonable grounds to suspect, that a transaction or attempted transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing.

For Canadian MSBs and payment service providers, STR decision-making is both operational and structural. It requires judgment, internal consistency, and documentation that supports the basis on which suspicion was formed.

This Wiki summarizes publicly available regulatory expectations and examination themes shaping STR analysis in Canada. It is a structured knowledge resource and does not constitute individualized legal advice. Nothing in this document modifies statutory obligations under the PCMLTFA.

## Section 1: Regulatory Developments
Under the reporting framework administered by FINTRAC, reporting entities must submit an STR where reasonable grounds to suspect exist.

Recent examination themes have emphasized:
- Narrative clarity within STR filings
- Pattern recognition across transactions or accounts
- Consistency between written compliance policies and operational practice
- Documentation supporting escalation and reporting decisions
- Oversight of crypto-related and cross-border activity

Examination practices suggest that regulators assess not only whether an STR was filed, but whether the reporting process reflects documented reasoning and consistent internal standards.

### Text Box: Suspicion vs. Reportability
Suspicion does not require certainty.

However, suspicion must be based on objectively reasonable grounds in light of available information.

Regulatory review may examine:
- How suspicion was identified
- Whether relevant indicators were documented
- Whether similar fact patterns were treated consistently

A filing decision that lacks contemporaneous documentation may be more difficult to explain during a regulatory review.

## Section 2: Threshold Elevators (TM)
### A Structured Internal Assessment Model
The Five Threshold Elevators (TM) are presented as an internal analytical framework. They do not replace or alter the statutory "reasonable grounds to suspect" standard.

Each elevator illustrates how converging indicators may elevate internal review toward a filing determination.

#### Indicative Assessment Levels
- Unusual
- Escalated
- Suspicion Identified
- Reportable (reasonable grounds to suspect)

These stages reflect internal escalation concepts only. The statutory obligation arises once reasonable grounds to suspect are formed.

#### Elevator 1 - Pattern
- Structuring
- Velocity spikes
- Recurring threshold proximity
- Repetitive behavioral indicators

#### Elevator 2 - Source of Funds
- Third-party deposits
- Crypto layering
- Inconsistent explanations
- Opaque beneficial ownership

#### Elevator 3 - Jurisdiction
- High-risk geographies
- Sanctions-adjacent routing
- Multi-border complexity

#### Elevator 4 - Profile Mismatch
- Activity inconsistent with onboarding information
- Dormant-to-active spikes
- Material volume deviations

#### Elevator 5 - Evasion Indicators
- Resistance to KYC updates
- Narrative inconsistencies
- Fragmented transaction behavior

Isolated indicators may not independently meet reporting thresholds. Converging indicators often warrant further internal escalation and assessment.

The objective is disciplined threshold evaluation before a filing determination is made.

### Text Box: Calibration - Over-Reporting vs. Under-Reporting
Under-reporting may expose an organization to regulatory findings.

Excessive or unsupported reporting may weaken narrative clarity and internal consistency.

The objective is not maximum reporting volume. It is defensible reporting supported by documented reasoning.

Defensible reporting commonly reflects:
- Structured threshold analysis
- Clear articulation of the basis for suspicion
- Consistent internal application of standards
- Contemporaneous documentation

Balanced calibration reflects compliance maturity.

## Section 3: Documentation Discipline
Many MSBs identify unusual activity. Fewer maintain structured written summaries of how reporting thresholds were assessed.

During regulatory examinations, entities may be asked to produce:
- Escalation logs
- Internal communications
- Documentation supporting threshold determinations
- Evidence of policy-to-practice alignment

Where written rationale does not exist, explaining past decisions may become more complex.

Sophisticated compliance environments often incorporate:
- Transaction mapping summaries
- Structured internal threshold memoranda
- Narrative drafting prior to STR submission
- Post-filing control observations

Structured documentation supports defensibility and internal governance clarity.

### Text Box: Confidentiality and Privilege Considerations
STR filings are confidential by law. Disclosure to the subject of a report is prohibited.

Internal materials relating to suspicion formation may be reviewed during regulatory examinations.

Organizations should be mindful of:
- Escalation documentation practices
- Communication discipline
- Record retention
- Counsel engagement structures

In certain circumstances, involvement of legal counsel may engage solicitor-client privilege considerations. The scope and application of privilege is fact-dependent and should be assessed carefully.

## Section 4: Structured Review Indicators
Structured internal review is often appropriate where:
- Cross-border exposure intersects with multiple indicators
- Crypto conversion activity is present
- Pattern-based activity evolves over time
- The organization has limited prior STR filing experience
- Internal uncertainty exists regarding whether reasonable grounds to suspect have been met

In these contexts, structured review may support:
- Clear articulation of suspicion
- Documentation completeness
- Policy alignment
- Consistent compliance response

The objective is a consistent and defensible compliance process.

## Final Section: Operational Considerations
Organizations may consider reviewing internally:
- Is threshold reasoning documented contemporaneously?
- Are escalation pathways clearly defined?
- Do STR narratives clearly articulate the basis for suspicion?
- Does monitoring activity align with reporting practice?

### Suspicious Transaction Triage and STR Filing (TM)
Levine Law supports structured internal assessment processes, including:
- Transaction mapping
- Written threshold assessment summaries
- STR narrative drafting support
- Filing process guidance
- Internal control observations

Our role is to support internal threshold assessment and documentation processes. The reporting entity retains responsibility for filing determinations under the PCMLTFA.

Designed for:
- Registered Canadian MSBs
- Payment service providers
- Crypto-enabled platforms
- Cross-border operators

Suspicion requires assessment.
Assessment benefits from documentation.
Documentation supports defensibility.

# Entry Offer 3: AML Health Check (TM) (Canada)

## Strategic Role in Funnel 3
If:
- Entry 1 = Regulatory Entry (MSB Registration)
- Entry 2 = Incident-Level Response (STR Triage)

Then:
- Entry 3 = Full Compliance Architecture Review

This is where serious operators realize: "Registration is not compliance."

## Who This Is For
Canadian reporting entities that:
- Are already registered (or clearly required to be)
- Have an AML program in place
- Have grown since implementation
- Have filed STRs but lack internal confidence
- Are preparing for bank review, partner scrutiny, or FINTRAC exam
- Have not completed a proper two-year effectiveness review

They are thinking:
- "Is our AML program defensible?"
- "Would we survive a FINTRAC review?"
- "Our policies exist -- but are they aligned to how we actually operate?"
- "Are we missing reporting triggers?"

They are not:
- Pre-revenue startups
- Paper-only registration clients
- Casual crypto projects
- One-off form shoppers

## What They Are Actually Buying
Not a policy rewrite. They are buying:
- Audit defensibility
- Structural clarity
- Risk prioritization
- Compliance maturity
- Institutional credibility

They want: "If FINTRAC reviews us tomorrow, we are prepared."

## Scope of the AML Health Check (TM)
Structured across 6 pillars.

### Pillar 1 - Risk Assessment Framework
- Is there a documented risk assessment?
- Does it reflect actual business model and geographies?
- Are high-risk categories defined properly?
- Is it periodically updated?
- Does it align with real transaction patterns?

Output: Risk Framework Adequacy Rating

### Pillar 2 - Policies and Procedures
- Are policies tailored or generic?
- Do procedures match actual operations?
- Are escalation processes clear?
- Are STR triggers defined?
- Is "reasonable grounds to suspect" understood internally?

Output: Policy Integrity Assessment

### Pillar 3 - Transaction Monitoring and Detection
- Manual vs automated detection?
- Are indicators documented?
- Is context considered?
- Are alerts escalated consistently?
- Is documentation defensible?

Output: Detection and Escalation Strength Rating

### Pillar 4 - Reporting Discipline
- Timeliness of STR filing
- Quality of narratives
- Structured field completion integrity
- Record retention (5-year requirement)
- Handling of subsequent suspicious transactions

Output: Reporting Quality Score

### Pillar 5 - Governance and Compliance Officer Structure
- Is a qualified compliance officer designated?
- Is authority clear?
- Is reporting to leadership documented?
- Board-level awareness (if applicable)?
- Independence of review function?

Output: Governance Alignment Rating

### Pillar 6 - Effectiveness Review and Testing
- Has a two-year effectiveness review been conducted?
- Is testing documented?
- Are deficiencies tracked?
- Is remediation recorded?
- Is there sector benchmarking?

Output: Effectiveness Review Gap Analysis

## Deliverables
Client receives:

1. Executive Compliance Summary (8-12 pages)
- Plain-language summary of: where they stand, where exposure exists, severity classification, regulatory risk tier

2. AML Maturity Matrix
- Scored across pillars: Foundational, Developing, Structured, Regulator-Ready

3. Prioritized Remediation Roadmap
- Structured as: Immediate (0-30 days), Near-term (90 days), Strategic (6-12 months)
- Each item includes: risk level, impact, estimated implementation scope

4. Optional Board-Ready Summary Slide
- For companies with governance layers

## Pricing Strategy
This must sit above STR Triage.

Suggested range:
- $6,500 - $15,000 fixed fee
(Scaled based on complexity, transaction volume, crypto exposure, cross-border footprint.)

This price signals:
- Institutional review
- Serious engagement
- Non-template work

## Conversion Path
The AML Health Check naturally converts into:
- Full AML program rewrite
- Monitoring system enhancement
- STR Playbook implementation
- Independent effectiveness review mandate
- Ongoing AML Counsel retainer

This entry offer should be your strongest retainer generator.

## Intake Gate Logic
Before booking, require:
- Registered reporting entity? (Y/N)
- Annual transaction volume range
- Virtual currency exposure?
- Cross-border activity?
- Compliance officer designated? (Y/N)
- Date of last effectiveness review?

Decline:
- No AML program in place (route to registration + framework setup)
- Individuals
- Entities unwilling to disclose volume

## Positioning Language
Tone must be:
- Calm
- Structured
- Non-alarmist
- Institutional

Avoid: "You're exposed."

Use: "Your program may be compliant -- but is it defensible?"

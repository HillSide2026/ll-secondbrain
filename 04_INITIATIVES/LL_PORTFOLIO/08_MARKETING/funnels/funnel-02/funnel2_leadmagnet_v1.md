# Funnel 2 Lead Magnet Draft

## Title Option A
Corporate Drift: How Ontario Businesses Outgrow Their Legal Structure

## Title Option B
Structural Alignment: A Quiet Risk in Growing Ontario Corporations

## Subtitle
Why governance, agreements, and capital structures often lag behind operational growth.

## Tone
Think: Harvard Business Review meets Bay Street counsel.
Not: "Are you doing this wrong?"

## Structure

### 1. The Growth-Structure Gap
As businesses scale from $1M to $8M revenue, operational complexity increases:
- New hires
- Informal equity promises
- Expanded customer contracts
- Bank financing
- Investor conversations

But legal structure often remains frozen at incorporation stage.

Not because founders are careless.

Because operations move faster than governance.

That gap is called structural drift.

### 2. Where Drift Typically Appears
Not as bullet questions.

But as quiet misalignments:

**Ownership Reality vs. Paper Reality**
Founders' roles evolve.
Equity expectations shift.
Compensation structures change.

Yet original shareholder agreements remain untouched.

**Authority vs. Accountability**
Directors are appointed.
Officers act.
Decisions are made.

But formal authority frameworks may not reflect actual decision-making patterns.

**Capital Structure vs. Growth Plans**
Businesses prepare for financing, acquisition, or partnership.

Yet cap tables are not verified.
Resolutions are incomplete.
Equity issuances were informal.

**Contractual Inconsistency**
Templates evolve over time.
Independent contractors become core contributors.
Termination clauses vary.

In isolation, none of this signals crisis.

In aggregate, it creates structural fragility.

### 3. Why This Matters -- Even Without Litigation
Structural misalignment does not usually surface during calm periods.

It surfaces during:
- Financing
- Due diligence
- Disputes
- Partner exits
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Banking review

The issue is not legality.

It is defensibility and clarity.

### 4. Signs a Business Is Ready for Structural Review
Notice this framing shift:

Not "you might be exposed."

But:

Businesses that benefit most from structured review typically:
- Have operated for 2+ years
- Have grown in headcount
- Have introduced new compensation structures
- Are considering capital events
- Want institutional maturity

This frames review as advancement, not correction.

### 5. Introducing the Ontario Corporate Health Check (TM)
Position calmly.

The Corporate Health Check (TM) is a structured structural stability audit.

It evaluates:
- Governance alignment
- Share structure integrity
- Contract architecture consistency
- Authority documentation
- Capital readiness

It does not rewrite your company.

It assesses whether your structure reflects how you actually operate.

## Closing Positioning
Most Ontario businesses are not broken.

They are simply outgrown.

Structural clarity is not reactive.

It is a marker of institutional maturity.

If your company has scaled meaningfully since incorporation, a structured review may be appropriate.

## Why This Version Works
It:
- Treats the reader as competent
- Avoids nagging tone
- Removes checklist pressure
- Normalizes drift
- Positions review as strategic
- Aligns with your maturity filter

# Funnel 01 — Toronto Corporate Lawyer

**Parent:** `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/`

This folder contains assets and workflows specific to Funnel 01 as defined in
`04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/README.md`.

## Operational Snapshot

Traffic source: Google Ads  
Keyword: corporate lawyer  
Geography: Ontario  
Reality: B2C distressed SMB / reactive legal need

Capture stack:
- Voice AI
- SMS follow-up (semi-automated)
- Intake form
- Parallel capture paths active

CRM / pipeline:
- System of record: GHL
- Pipeline managed inside GHL

## Critical Clarification

This is not corporate law marketing in practice. Observed persona:
- Small business owners
- Cash-flow dependent
- Likely distressed or reactive
- Likely not enterprise or GC-type clients

Implication: The keyword “corporate lawyer” does not match the buyer psychology entering the funnel.

## Strategic Reality

This funnel is barely break-even. The agency cannot acquire other client types. That implies one or more of:
- The keyword attracts only this segment.
- The landing and intake positioning filters everyone else out.
- Market demand in Ontario for that keyword is mostly distressed SMB.

Treat this as an empirical fact until disproven by new evidence.

## Current Funnel 1 (Status Quo)

- Keyword-led
- Crisis-skewed
- Volume-oriented
- Reactive intake structure

## New Core Offer

Instead of: “Speak to a Corporate Lawyer”

Primary offer:
Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service

A structured legal function for growing Ontario businesses, providing ongoing governance, contract, employment, and risk oversight.

This signals:
- LL assumes growth
- LL assumes seriousness
- LL assumes a long-term relationship

## Observed Inbound Profile (Current Reality)
Small business owners facing reactive or distressed legal needs in Ontario. This is who the funnel currently attracts.

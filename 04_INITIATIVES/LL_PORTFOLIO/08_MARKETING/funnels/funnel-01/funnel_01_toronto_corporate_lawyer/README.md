# Funnel 01 — Toronto Corporate Lawyer

**Parent:** `04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/`

This folder contains assets and workflows specific to Funnel 01 as defined in
`04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/08_MARKETING/README.md`.

## Operational Snapshot

Traffic source: Google Ads  
Keyword: corporate lawyer  
Geography: Ontario  
Reality: B2C distressed SMB / reactive legal need

Capture stack:
- Voice AI
- SMS follow-up (semi-automated)
- Intake form
- Parallel capture paths active

CRM / pipeline:
- System of record: GHL
- Pipeline managed inside GHL

## Critical Clarification

This is not corporate law marketing in practice. Observed persona:
- Small business owners
- Cash-flow dependent
- Likely distressed or reactive
- Likely not enterprise or GC-type clients

Implication: The keyword “corporate lawyer” does not match the buyer psychology entering the funnel.

## Strategic Reality

This funnel is barely break-even. The agency cannot acquire other client types. That implies one or more of:
- The keyword attracts only this segment.
- The landing and intake positioning filters everyone else out.
- Market demand in Ontario for that keyword is mostly distressed SMB.

Treat this as an empirical fact until disproven by new evidence.

## Identity Definition

LL is:
- Risk stabilizer
- Governance architect
- Commercial legal operator
- Long-term partner

That means:
LL’s marketing must attract operators thinking in quarters and years, not days.

## Strategic Reframe of Funnel 1

Current Funnel 1:
- Keyword-led
- Crisis-skewed
- Volume-oriented
- Reactive intake structure

Target Funnel (aligned to Identity B):
- Maturity-led
- Preventative positioning
- Qualification-heavy
- Structured assessment entry point

## New Core Offer

Instead of: “Speak to a Corporate Lawyer”

Primary offer:
Fractional Counsel / Legal Function as a Service

A structured legal function for growing Ontario businesses, providing ongoing governance, contract, employment, and risk oversight.

This signals:
- LL assumes growth
- LL assumes seriousness
- LL assumes a long-term relationship

## Observed Inbound Profile (Current Reality)
Small business owners facing reactive or distressed legal needs in Ontario. This is who the funnel currently attracts.

## Target Client (Economic Buyer)
### Target Reader (Entry-Level Audience)
Founder or owner of an Ontario business:
- $1M–$8M revenue
- 5–30 employees
- Accountant involved
- Has signed contracts without formal review
- Has contractor or employment classification grey areas
- Has a shareholder structure drafted early in the business

Confirmed roles:
- Owner-operator
- Founder (5–20 employee business)
- Managing director of a privately held corporation
- Family business successor
- Incorporated contractor scaling into employer

Reader maturity profile:
- Lean internal team (no in‑house counsel)
- Lawyer used reactively
- Has encountered at least one legal scare (contract dispute, unpaid invoice, employee issue, partnership tension)
- Knows they are winging it legally but has not systematized
- Not in meltdown, but feels exposed

They are capable business people. They are not sophisticated about corporate structuring. They do not want to be embarrassed for not knowing.

### Target Economic Buyer
An Ontario business owner who realizes: “If something goes wrong, we’re not protected.”

Typical triggers:
- Accountant flags structural risk
- Investor discussions introduce governance scrutiny
- Transition from contractors to employees
- Growth beyond the original partnership structure
- Preparing for financing or expansion

Conversion is maturity-based, not panic-based.

### What Entry Content Must Deliver
- Plain‑English guidance
- Clear framing of what corporate legal hygiene means
- Sequencing of what matters now vs later
- Calm authority (not alarmist, not academic)
- Visible business literacy (revenue, margin, contracts — not just statutes)

The goal is not to impress. The goal is to stabilize.

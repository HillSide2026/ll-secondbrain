# Scope Definition

Project ID: LLP-011
Project Path: 08_MARKETING/LLP-011_FUNNEL1_MANAGEMENT
Stage: Planning

## Implementation Objective
Define the controlled execution scope, KPI architecture, and gate criteria required to implement Funnel 01 as a governed reactive-acquisition channel.
Implementation scope must cover the full funnel lifecycle from lead capture through conversion (`retained`).

## In Scope
- Funnel 01 implementation for the active acquisition path (`Google Ads -> GHL Intake`).
- Full pre-matter funnel lifecycle coverage from `lead_captured` -> `screened` -> `booked` -> `consult_complete` -> `retained` (conversion).
- Qualification-gate implementation (`revenue_min`, `employee_min`, intake form required).
- Campaign asset and editorial QA controls for approved messaging only.
- Distribution and follow-up execution sequencing for pre-matter lifecycle stages.
- KPI and baseline operation for lead quality, consult progression, and retained outcomes.
- Dependency and escalation controls for external systems used by Funnel 01.

## Out of Scope
- Creating new funnels or replacing Funnel 01 with Funnel 02.
- Doctrine changes or policy reinterpretation.
- Legal advice, legal delivery work, or post-conversion matter execution.
- Autonomous acceptance/rejection of clients without ML1 approval.

## Implementation Readiness Deliverables
- `WORKPLAN.md`
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`
- `METRIC_DEFINITION.md`
- `MEASUREMENT_METHOD.md`
- `BASELINE_CAPTURE_PERIOD.md`
- `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`
- `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md`

## Gate Criteria for Implementation Authorization
- Scope boundaries are explicit and approved by ML1.
- Implementation-readiness artifacts are complete and internally consistent.
- KPI definitions and measurement method are implementation-ready.
- Risk register and mitigations are documented for scope, schedule, budget, financial, and strategic execution risk.

## Stage 2 Scope (Planning Horizon — Not Yet Authorized for Execution)

The following items are in scope for planning-stage design and are defined in the WORKPLAN Stage 2 section. They extend Funnel 01 beyond its current reactive-acquisition state. None may be executed without a separate ML1 Stage 2 authorization.

| Item | Description | Dependency |
|---|---|---|
| S2-WS-01 Intake gate hardwiring | Embed qualification questions into opt-in/booking button so the ICP-01 gate cannot be bypassed | ML1 threshold confirmation |
| S2-WS-02 Lead magnet | All F01 leads receive a Structuring-aligned lead magnet at intake; filters for ICP-01 and warms non-bookers | Lead magnet content created and ML1-approved |
| S2-WS-03 Structuring keywords | Add Structuring keyword cluster to Google Ads alongside existing reactive keywords; separate ad group for measurement | Keyword shortlist from LLP-025 IMP-05 SEO research; ML1 approval |
| S2-WS-04 Setter role | Setter handles lead qualification follow-up, consult booking, and pre-consult screening; frees ML1 capacity | Role definition, compensation model, GHL workflow — all ML1-approved |
| S2-WS-05 Senior lawyer delivery | Senior lawyer handles matter execution for F01 retained clients; ML1 retains oversight and relationship | Role definition, matter eligibility list, supervision model — all ML1-approved |

**Stage 2 is explicitly out of scope for Stage 1 execution.** These items appear here for planning continuity, not as authorized work.

# LL_PORTFOLIO — Levine Law Workstream Registry

## Meta-Rule

> **ML2 preserves ML1 intent. It does not approximate, infer, or replace it.**
>
> **When in doubt: STOP. LABEL. ESCALATE.**

---

## Core Definition

The LL Portfolio is a **governed, non-autonomous registry** where:

- **ML1** is the sole authority for judgment, approval, pricing, and strategy
- **ML2** preserves structure, scope, constraints, and state
- **LL** consumes ONLY ML1-approved outputs

## Portfolio Review Entry Points

Use these files to review the LL portfolio quickly:

- `LL_PORTFOLIO_REVIEW.md` — single front door for the portfolio review stack
- `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/README.md` — canonical synthesis layer for ML1 review
- `LL_PROGRAM_REVIEW_MATRIX.md` — fast path for program-by-program review
- `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md` — current summary of the 9 numbered programs

When the Chief of Staff packet is current, start with:

1. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/COS_BRIEF.md`
2. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/ML1_DECISION_QUEUE.md`

When the Chief of Staff packet is stale, start with:

1. `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md`
2. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/PORTFOLIO_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`
3. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md`
4. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/PROJECT_HEALTH_ROLLUP.md`

## Review Hierarchy

The intended review hierarchy for Levine Law is:

1. Portfolio
2. Relevant programs
3. Relevant projects
4. Matters

That means matters sit inside the LL operating picture. They are not a
separate peer portfolio even though their source-of-truth files live under
`05_MATTERS/`.

## Project Identity (Canonical)

- Every project has one canonical identifier: `Project ID` (globally unique).
- `Project Path` is a storage/location key and must not be treated as identity.
- Folder labels in paths (for example `LLP-004_ONBOARDING`) are legacy slugs and non-authoritative for identity.

## LL Work Type Taxonomy (Canonical)

The LL system recognizes four work types:

- Strategic projects
- Management projects
- Operational projects
- Client matters (aka client projects)

Definitions:

- Strategic projects: firm-direction initiatives that define or materially change long-horizon operating posture.
- Management projects: governance and control initiatives that coordinate, monitor, or optimize firm systems.
- Operational projects: execution-focused initiatives that improve how defined workflows are carried out.
- Client matters/client projects: client-specific legal work units governed by matter doctrine.

Applicability:

- The project stage-gate artifact lifecycle applies to strategic, management, and operational projects.
- Client matters/client projects follow matter doctrine and matter-stage artifacts.
- If project type classification is unclear, escalate to ML1 before stage advancement.

## Planning Stage Standard (Canonical)

For governed LL projects, the `Planning` stage exists to prepare a clean
implementation-authorization decision.

Planning artifacts must be:

- project-specific
- decision-oriented
- implementation-focused
- as lean as possible while still supporting ML1 approval

Planning artifacts must not become planning for the sake of planning.

Required planning artifact set:

Strategic and management projects:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md`
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`
- `METRICS.md`

Operational projects:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md`
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `METRICS.md`

Operational projects may add these when the work actually needs them:

- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`

Planning best-practice rules:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md` locks the actual implementation boundary and exclusions.
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` locks the project decisions, sequence, and gate-readiness path. It should not read like generic PM overhead. Legacy `WORKPLAN.md` files remain acceptable during transition and should be normalized on next edit.
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` captures the assumptions the project depends on and the limits it cannot cross.
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` lists only dependencies that could materially affect implementation or authorization.
- `RISK_REGISTER.md` tracks risks that matter to scope, schedule, budget, operating control, or gate readiness.
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` should be minimal and limited to decision loops, coordination points, and escalation triggers. It is expected by default for strategic and management projects and optional for operational projects unless coordination complexity warrants it.
- `METRICS.md` is the single source for metric definitions, measurement method, baseline logic, validation rules, and ML1 threshold approval. `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` is legacy and should not be created for new work.

If a planning artifact does not help lock scope, reduce uncertainty, or support
the Planning -> Executing gate decision, it should be merged or removed.

**This structure is LOCKED unless explicitly changed by ML1.**

You must not infer, reorder, merge, or repurpose these folders.

## Review Support Artifacts Outside the 9 Numbered Programs

program directories:

- `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/`
- `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md`
- `LL_PROJECT_DIGEST.md`
- `LL_PROJECT_DIGEST.tsv`
- `LL_GLOSSARY.md`

# LL_PORTFOLIO — Levine Law Workstream Registry

## Meta-Rule

> **ML2 preserves ML1 intent. It does not approximate, infer, or replace it.**
>
> **When in doubt: STOP. LABEL. ESCALATE.**

---

## Core Definition

The LL Portfolio is a **governed, non-autonomous registry** where:

- **ML1** is the sole authority for judgment, approval, pricing, and strategy
- **ML2** preserves structure, scope, constraints, and state
- **LL** consumes ONLY ML1-approved outputs

## Portfolio Review Entry Points

Use these files to review the LL portfolio quickly:

- `LL_PORTFOLIO_REVIEW.md` — single front door for the portfolio review stack
- `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/README.md` — canonical synthesis layer for ML1 review
- `LL_PROGRAM_REVIEW_MATRIX.md` — fast path for program-by-program review
- `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md` — current summary of the 9 numbered programs

When the Chief of Staff packet is current, start with:

1. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/COS_BRIEF.md`
2. `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/ML1_DECISION_QUEUE.md`

When the Chief of Staff packet is stale, start with:

1. `LL_PROGRAM_SUMMARY_REPORT.md`
2. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT/PORTFOLIO_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`
3. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PORTFOLIO_GOVERNANCE/GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md`
4. `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/PROJECT_HEALTH_ROLLUP.md`

## Review Hierarchy

The intended review hierarchy for Levine Law is:

1. Portfolio
2. Relevant programs
3. Relevant projects
4. Matters

That means matters sit inside the LL operating picture. They are not a
separate peer portfolio even though their source-of-truth files live under
`05_MATTERS/`.

## Project Identity (Canonical)

- Every project has one canonical identifier: `Project ID` (globally unique).
- `Project Path` is a storage/location key and must not be treated as identity.
- Folder labels in paths (for example `LLP-004_ONBOARDING`) are legacy slugs and non-authoritative for identity.

---

## LL Work Type Taxonomy (Canonical)

The LL system recognizes four work types:

- Strategic projects
- Management projects
- Operational projects
- Client matters (aka client projects)

Definitions:

- Strategic projects: firm-direction initiatives that define or materially change long-horizon operating posture.
- Management projects: governance and control initiatives that coordinate, monitor, or optimize firm systems.
- Operational projects: execution-focused initiatives that improve how defined workflows are carried out.
- Client matters/client projects: client-specific legal work units governed by matter doctrine.

Applicability:

- The project stage-gate artifact lifecycle applies to strategic, management, and operational projects.
- Client matters/client projects follow matter doctrine and matter-stage artifacts.
- If project type classification is unclear, escalate to ML1 before stage advancement.

## Planning Stage Standard (Canonical)

For governed LL projects, the `Planning` stage exists to prepare a clean
implementation-authorization decision.

Planning artifacts must be:

- project-specific
- decision-oriented
- implementation-focused
- as lean as possible while still supporting ML1 approval

Planning artifacts must not become planning for the sake of planning.

Required planning artifact set:

Strategic and management projects:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md`
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`
- `METRICS.md`

Operational projects:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md`
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `METRICS.md`

Operational projects may add these when the work actually needs them:

- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`

Planning best-practice rules:

- `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md` locks the actual implementation boundary and exclusions.
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` locks the project decisions, sequence, and gate-readiness path. It should not read like generic PM overhead. Legacy `WORKPLAN.md` files remain acceptable during transition and should be normalized on next edit.
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` captures the assumptions the project depends on and the limits it cannot cross.
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` lists only dependencies that could materially affect implementation or authorization.
- `RISK_REGISTER.md` tracks risks that matter to scope, schedule, budget, operating control, or gate readiness.
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` should be minimal and limited to decision loops, coordination points, and escalation triggers. It is expected by default for strategic and management projects and optional for operational projects unless coordination complexity warrants it.
- `METRICS.md` is the single source for metric definitions, measurement method, baseline logic, validation rules, and ML1 threshold approval. `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` is legacy and should not be created for new work.

If a planning artifact does not help lock scope, reduce uncertainty, or support
the Planning -> Executing gate decision, it should be merged or removed.

## Portfolio Definitions

### 01_ACCOUNTING (Accounting)

**Purpose:** Govern accounting across bookkeeping, management accounting, budgeting, financial risk, and cash/collections.

**Characteristics:** Layered accounting domain; each artifact must label whether it is bookkeeping, management accounting, budgeting, financial risk, or cash/collections.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Bookkeeping records | Unlabelled mixing of accounting layers |
| Historical financial statements | Treating management accounting as bookkeeping |
| Reconciliations | Pricing decisions without ML1 approval |
| Invoices, payments, expense logs | Recommendations or optimization without explicit authority |
| Management accounting: revenue security, recurring vs one-off, revenue timing, trust-funded vs unsecured AR, matter-level profitability, lawyer production, WIP conversion, collection reliability | Unsupported assumptions about the future |
| Budgeting boundaries and controls | Treating budget outputs as operating decisions |

**Rule:** Accounting artifacts may inform decisions, but bookkeeping, management accounting, budgeting, financial risk, and cash/collections must be labelled and not collapsed into one another.

---

### 02_PRACTICE_AREAS

**Purpose:** Durable legal operating knowledge by domain.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Playbooks, checklists, standards | Client-specific material |
| ML1-approved doctrine | Pricing, strategy |
| Version tracking | "Common practice" as authority |

---

### 03_FIRM_OPERATIONS

**Purpose:** How the firm runs day-to-day.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| SOPs | Policy decisions |
| Process documentation | Enforcement without ML1 approval |
| Templates, internal workflows | Financial modeling |

---

### 04_RISK

**Purpose:** Defensive clarity and audit readiness.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Risk registers | Declaring compliance status |
| Compliance doctrines | Closing issues autonomously |
| Violation tracking, resolution logs | Waiving controls |

---

### 05_MATTER_DOCKETING

**Purpose:** Delivery and docketing overlay for matters in the system of record.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Matter State tracking (delivery posture) | Billing, accounting, collections |
| Activity Period tagging | CRM, intake, sales, pre-engagement |
| Delivery-related lawyer to-dos | Pricing, strategy, financial modeling |
| Email-to-operations-queue event mapping | Modifying Clio source-of-truth fields |
| Suggested operations queue transitions (ML1 approval required) | Auto-applying State/Period changes without authorization |

---

### 06_FINANCIAL_PORTFOLIO (Finance)

**Purpose:** Govern non-operating finance matters: capital, liabilities, strategic banking, tax-planning interfaces, major asset/liability decisions, investment/reserve policy, corporate finance, acquisition financing, and partner/shareholder distribution structures.

**Characteristics:** Strategic finance domain. This is distinct from Accounting, which governs bookkeeping, management accounting, budgeting, financial risk, and cash/collections.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| External financing, including shareholder funding | Bookkeeping records |
| Debt facilities, including credit cards and credit lines | Management accounting revenue classification |
| Tax-planning interfaces, including pension and health insurance | Operating cash/collections workflow |
| Major asset/liability decisions, including leases | Matter-level WIP conversion analysis |
| Strategic banking relationships | Budget baseline control unless expressly cross-referenced |
| Investment / reserve policy | Treating finance models as decisions |
| Corporate finance decisions, including property acquisition through LawCo | Auto-feeding outputs into operations or sales |
| M&A or acquisition financing, including buying a book of business |  |
| Partner/shareholder distributions, including recruiting a lawyer with a book of business |  |

**Critical Boundary:**
- Accounting governs the operating money system.
- Finance governs capital, balance-sheet structure, strategic banking, tax interfaces, and major transactions.
- Finance artifacts are advisory unless ML1 approves a specific decision.

---

### 07_GROWTH_PROJECTS

**Purpose:** Change, experimentation, and future direction.

**Characteristics:** Explicitly NON-AUTHORITATIVE until approved, judgment-heavy

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Strategy drafts | Operating rules |
| Tradeoff analysis | Execution |
| Scenario exploration | Silent promotion into operations or pricing |

---

### 08_MARKETING

**Purpose:** Pre-matter pipeline for how potential work enters the firm.

**Characteristics:** Pre-matter only, ends at end of marketing conversion, no delivery semantics

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Lead capture and tracking | Legal delivery work |
| Intake qualification | Docketing or capacity management |
| Conversion workflow and fulfillment handoff package | Modifying delivery states or periods |
| Conversion analytics | Billing, accounting, pricing decisions |
| Handoff to Matter Docketing | Accepting/rejecting work autonomously |

**Critical Boundary:**
- Marketing ends at the end of Conversion (marketing term)
- Fulfillment begins at Onboarding (fulfillment term)
- Matter Docketing begins when a matter exists
- **They must not overlap.**

---

### 09_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT

**Purpose:** Service-tier control map used to classify and monitor service posture.

| ALLOWED | PROHIBITED |
|---------|------------|
| Tier classification and service status tracking | Replacing matter/source-of-truth records |

# LL_PORTFOLIO

## Purpose
Initiatives whose primary purpose is to improve how Levine Law operates, using the Second Brain system as a tool and governance layer.

These initiatives focus on firm-level execution, operational consistency, and productization. They apply system doctrine and playbooks but do not modify system governance by default.

## Examples
- Intake design and formalization
- Matter lifecycle design and formalization
- Playbook design, development, and rollouts
- Firm-wide business systems and business process documentation, including:
  - guidelines
  - SOPs
  - checklists
- Productization efforts

## Boundary rule
Outputs from LL Portfolio initiatives may result in new or updated playbooks and templates for firm use. They do not change system doctrine or governance unless explicitly promoted and approved.

# LLP-003_WEEKLY_REPORT — Weekly Matter Docketing Report

## Purpose

Govern the weekly delivery-facing matter report so ML1 receives a consistent, bounded summary of docketing state, activity periods, blockers, and next actions without altering the source-of-truth systems.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Weekly matter-docketing summary structure and cadence
- Delivery-state visibility, blockers, and escalations
- Read-only aggregation from existing matter systems

### Upstream Relationship

- The weekly report may consume fulfillment-readiness and queue signals from
  `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/FULFILLMENT_MATTER_QUEUE/`.
- The weekly report may also consume lawyer-facing derivative visibility from
  `LLP-023 Matter Command and Control`.
- `LLP-003` does not own either upstream layer; it is a bounded reporting
  surface that summarizes them for delivery use.

### Out of Scope

- Modifying Clio source-of-truth fields
- Billing, accounting, intake, or marketing reporting
- Autonomous prioritization or matter acceptance decisions

## Relevant Artifacts

- `initiation/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`
- `initiation/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- `initiation/SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md`
- `initiation/STAKEHOLDERS.md`
- `initiation/RISK_SCAN.md`
- `initiation/APPROVAL_RECORD.md`

## Approval State

**INITIATING** — The weekly-report packet now has a canonical initiation set.

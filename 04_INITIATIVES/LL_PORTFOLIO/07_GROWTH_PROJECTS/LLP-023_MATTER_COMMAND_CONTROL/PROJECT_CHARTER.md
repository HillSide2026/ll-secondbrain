# Project Charter
Project ID: LLP-26-23
Project Name: Matter Command and Control
Portfolio: 02_Levine_Law_Portfolio
Project Type: Strategic Project
Stage: Initiation

## 1. Purpose
Build a single command and control layer for matters that improves visibility, assignment, and response cadence without creating a new system of record.

## 2. Nature of Project
Control-plane instrumentation and orchestration.
Read connectors only.
Derived artifacts only.
No source-of-truth override authority.

## 3. Strategic Rationale
- Reduce matter blind spots across inbox, status, and documents.
- Create deterministic morning visibility on movement, stalls, and exceptions.
- Enforce citation-backed assertions to prevent hallucinated matter state.
- Maintain boundary discipline: Clio/SharePoint/Gmail remain authoritative.

## 4. High-Level Deliverables
- Daily `MATTER_DIGEST.md`
- Per-matter `MATTER_STATUS.md` thread routing snapshots
- `INBOX_UNMAPPED.md` exception stream
- Deterministic connector normalization contracts
- Slice-based implementation path (Index -> Docs -> Deadlines -> Drafts)

## 5. Authority
Final approval authority: ML1.

## 6. Promotion Path
Outputs may migrate to:
- `03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/MATTER_OPERATIONS_QUEUE`
- `05_MATTER_DOCKETING`
- `00_SYSTEM/orchestration`

No production governance activation without explicit ML1 approval.

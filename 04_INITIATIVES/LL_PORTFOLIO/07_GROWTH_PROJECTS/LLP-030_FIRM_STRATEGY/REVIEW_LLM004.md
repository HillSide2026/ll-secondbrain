## 1. Internal Consistency

The three-document set is structurally coherent on its core claims. Priority order, capacity gating, the no-hire-until-stable staffing doctrine, and the 2026–2028 horizon all read consistently across FIRM_STRATEGY.md, BUSINESS_PLAN.md, and README.md. No document contradicts another on those structural points.

**Four contradictions or tensions require resolution:**

**C1 — Q1 revenue target vs. current date.** Q1 ends in nine days. The Business Plan targets $10K–$12K/month as the Q1 exit. None of the reviewed documents show whether this is on track. If Q1 is missed, Q2's F02 launch is immediately under pressure because F02 is supposed to layer onto a stable F01 base, not compensate for a shortfall.

**C2 — Monthly ceiling vs. annual target math.** The capacity ceiling is ~$25K–$30K/month. Q4 target is $22K–$25K/month. The $240K annual target is only achievable if the Q1–Q3 ramp executes on schedule. If Q2 or Q3 underperforms, the annual target cannot be recovered within the capacity ceiling. No contingency is stated.

**C3 — F03 is gated behind an unresolved F02 dependency.** FIRM_STRATEGY.md section 7 states F02 build cannot begin until scope, price, and intake gate are ML1-approved. The F02 price ($1,500–$2,500) is listed as a hypothesis in FINANCIAL_MODEL.md — not yet approved. F03 activation is explicitly blocked until the F02 landing page is live. A delay to F02 approval is therefore a simultaneous delay to both F02 and F03 contribution targets.

**C4 — Andersen revenue treatment is unresolved.** FINANCIAL_MODEL.md flags that Levine Law may need Andersen fees credited to reach the $80K owner compensation target, but the default excludes them. BUSINESS_PLAN.md makes no mention of this. If Andersen revenue is excluded and direct billings must cover the $240K target alone, this is a material constraint not surfaced in the operating plan.

## 2. Assumptions at Risk

**A1 — Lead-to-consult conversion (25–30%, unvalidated).** The financial model flags this as needing 30-day data. If actual conversion is 15–20%, F01 matter volume is materially lower. The $240K target has no validated revenue model behind it — it is a target, not a projection.

**A2 — Consult-to-retained conversion (40–50%, unvalidated).** Combined with A1, the range of plausible retained-client outcomes from inbound traffic is roughly a factor of two.

**A3 — Average F01 matter value (unknown, explicitly an open item).** The most critical gap. Without this number, there is no revenue model for F01. The $240K target is not derivable from the inputs in FINANCIAL_MODEL.md.

**A4 — F02 Health Check to fractional counsel conversion (hypothesis, not yet launched).** F02's Q4 contribution target of 40–50% of revenue depends on Health Check completions converting to retained ongoing counsel. That rate is entirely unvalidated. If operators want a report but not a relationship, F02 revenue does not compound.

**A5 — Accountant referral activation speed.** No assumptions stated about referral network density or activation lag. Professional services referral channels typically have a 6–18 month lag. If that applies, F02 does not produce material 2026 volume.

**A6 — F03 SEO attribution timeline.** F03 is projected to contribute 10–20% in Q3 and 20–30% in Q4 starting from Q3 activation. Organic SEO for niche legal content typically requires 6–12 months to compound. This is not flagged anywhere in the documents.

**A7 — Overhead held constant.** The staffing trigger model does not price out setter or senior lawyer costs. If either role is needed due to early success, the overhead line changes materially and no scenario models this.

## 3. Stage Gate and Artifact Gaps

**Current stage:** Initiating — ML1 approved 2026-03-19.

**Missing artifacts for Planning (Stage 2) advancement:**

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| SCOPE_STATEMENT.md | Missing |
| WORKPLAN.md | Missing — milestones exist in BUSINESS_PLAN.md but no formal artifact |
| ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md | Missing |
| DEPENDENCIES.md | Missing — dependencies named in README but not formally documented |
| RISK_REGISTER.md | Missing — RISK_SCAN.md exists at initiation only |
| COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md | Missing |
| METRICS.md | Missing |
| FINANCIAL_MODEL.md (complete) | Stub — explicitly not drafted |

**Open ML1 decisions blocking Planning artifacts:**
1. Matter value floor — must be defined before financial model can be drafted
2. F02 Health Check scope and price — must be ML1-approved before F02 build begins
3. 30-day F01 conversion data — required to validate financial model inputs
4. Andersen revenue credit rule — ML1 must explicitly decide

## 4. Single Points of Failure

**SPF-1 — ML1 is the only revenue source in 2026.** No mitigation for extended ML1 unavailability is documented.

**SPF-2 — F01 is the only validated channel.** If F01 degrades (CPC increases, policy change, algorithm shift), there is no active backup and no contingency.

**SPF-3 — F03 activation runs entirely through F02.** A delay to F02 launch simultaneously delays F03. No independent path to F03 exists.

**SPF-4 — Accountant referral is F02's only stated distribution mechanism.** No secondary F02 distribution path exists if accountant referrals do not activate.

**SPF-5 — No recovery plan if $240K is missed.** The plan does not state what happens below target — what gets cut, whether owner compensation adjusts, whether 2027 buildout defers. No scenario below $200K reference floor is modeled.

## 5. Verdict

**Not ready to govern execution. Defined work required before Planning stage advancement.**

The strategy is directionally sound. Priority ordering, capacity discipline, and channel sequencing are coherent and consistently stated. The 2026–2028 horizon holds together.

The problem is the financial model — the mechanism that validates whether the strategy is executable, not just logical — is a stub with three unresolved open items. Without a completed financial model, the $240K target is a stated intention, not a projection. The strategy cannot govern execution decisions (channel investment, staffing triggers, matter floor enforcement) if the revenue model is empty.

Five of eight required Planning-stage artifacts are missing. Four ML1 decisions must be resolved before those artifacts can be drafted.

**The strategy should not advance to Planning until:**
1. ML1 defines the matter value floor
2. ML1 confirms the Andersen revenue treatment rule
3. 30-day F01 conversion data is collected and entered into the model
4. ML1 approves F02 Health Check scope and price
5. FINANCIAL_MODEL.md is drafted with actual inputs

Until those five items are closed, these documents are a well-structured strategic intent statement — useful for alignment, not sufficient for governing project execution.

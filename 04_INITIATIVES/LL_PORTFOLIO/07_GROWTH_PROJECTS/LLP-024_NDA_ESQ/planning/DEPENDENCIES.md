# Dependencies

Project ID: LLP-024
Project Path: 04_INITIATIVES/LL_PORTFOLIO/07_STRATEGIC_PROJECTS/LLP-024_NDA_ESQ
Stage: Planning

## Governance Dependencies

- `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`
- `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md`
- `STAKEHOLDERS.md`
- `RISKS_INITIAL.md`
- `APPROVAL_RECORD.md`
- ongoing ML1 availability for stage-gate and threshold decisions

## Product Dependencies

- web application build environment
- guided-input flow for NDA generation
- GPT-4 API integration for NDA generation
- template/version-control method for the AI generation workflow
- user authentication and account-management layer
- document generation and delivery layer

## Commercial Dependencies

- Stripe account and subscription/payment configuration
- pricing and package definitions approved by ML1
- checkout and confirmation flow
- customer email infrastructure for confirmations, delivery, and upsell paths

## Growth Dependencies

- Google Ads account access and campaign configuration
- LinkedIn Ads account access and campaign configuration
- SEO/content publishing workflow
- outreach tooling and list-building process
- referral and affiliate program structure
- coordination with Funnel 02 only where customer-acquisition surfaces overlap,
  without subordinating `LLP-024_NDA_ESQ` to `LLP-012_FUNNEL2_MANAGEMENT`

## Operations Dependencies

- analytics event tracking for usage and conversion
- revenue dashboard or BI tooling
- support and ticketing or chat workflow
- billing and subscription management workflow
- periodic review cadence for churn, retention, CAC, LTV, and support load

## Dependency Risks

- Delays in AI, payment, or auth integration can push the MVP beyond the target window.
- Missing analytics instrumentation can block KPI operation and validation.
- Channel or platform access gaps can delay acquisition tests.
- Weak support or billing workflows can undermine retention and customer trust immediately after launch.

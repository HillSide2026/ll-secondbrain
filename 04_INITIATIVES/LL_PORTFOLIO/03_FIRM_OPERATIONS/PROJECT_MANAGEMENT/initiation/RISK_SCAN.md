# Risk Scan

Project ID: LLP-043
Project Path: 03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT

## Top 5 Risks
1. Authority risk: advisory project-management outputs may be mistaken for
   binding approval decisions.
2. Scope risk: project management may drift into portfolio sequencing or Chief
   of Staff synthesis work.
3. Doctrine risk: tooling outputs may carry stale schema expectations that
   overstate project non-compliance.
4. Operating risk: rollups may become stale or low-trust while still being used
   in ML1 review.
5. Overhead risk: governance tooling may expand faster than the decision value
   it creates.

## Key Assumptions
- ML1 remains the sole approval authority for stage advancement and scope.
- Project-level source artifacts remain the authoritative inputs to rollups.
- The project-management layer stays read-only and advisory by default.
- Portfolio review will continue to use project-health and stage-gate outputs.
- Tooling normalization work can remain narrower than a full operations
  rearchitecture.

## Go / No-Go Judgment
Decision: Proceed with Conditions
Rationale: Proceed only if ML1 wants an explicit governed packet for project
management tooling and keeps the scope bounded to advisory governance support.

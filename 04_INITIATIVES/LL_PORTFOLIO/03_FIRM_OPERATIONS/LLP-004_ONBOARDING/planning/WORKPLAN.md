# Workplan

Project ID: LLP-004
Project Path: 03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/LLP-004_ONBOARDING
Stage: Planning

## Implementation Objective
Prepare immediate implementation of a bounded onboarding function that reliably moves qualified leads to engagement authorization.

## Implementation Workstreams

| Workstream | Scope | Primary Owner | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-01 Onboarding Boundary and Handoff Spec | Finalize exact Gate 1 entry definition, Gate 2 completion definition, and required handoff packet to LLP-005 | ML1 | `SCOPE_DEFINITION.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| WS-02 Engagement Workflow Plan | Define agreement drafting/sending/signature workflow, ownership, and 24-hour send SLA operating rule | ML1 | `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| WS-03 Pending Matter Readiness Plan | Define required Clio `Pending` fields, minimum artifact set, and pre-handoff readiness checklist (planning spec only) | Intake/Admin operations | `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| WS-04 KPI and Approval Package | Finalize planning-stage KPI definitions, formulas, reporting rules, baseline window, and ML1 threshold approval | ML1 | `METRIC_DEFINITION.md`, `MEASUREMENT_METHOD.md`, `BASELINE_CAPTURE_PERIOD.md`, `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`, `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` |

## Execution Sequence
1. Finalize onboarding boundary and Gate 2 handoff requirements.
2. Lock engagement workflow and 24-hour agreement-send rule.
3. Finalize pending-matter readiness checklist and ownership.
4. Finalize KPI package and ML1 threshold approvals.
5. Submit Planning -> Executing gate packet.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 - Planning pack drafted | 2026-03-09 | complete | `planning/` artifacts |
| M2 - Boundary and handoff spec finalized | 2026-03-11 | planned | `SCOPE_DEFINITION.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| M3 - Engagement + pending readiness plan finalized | 2026-03-12 | planned | `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| M4 - KPI package and thresholds finalized | 2026-03-13 | planned | KPI artifacts + `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` |
| M5 - Planning -> Executing packet submitted | 2026-03-14 | planned | Updated approval records |

## Resource Plan

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| ML1 | Final approval authority |
| Intake/Admin operations | Agreement processing support and pending-readiness execution ownership |
| Onboarding Orchestrator | Compile planning packet and manage weekly planning cadence |

## Systems / Tools
- Intake/consult records
- Engagement agreement workflow
- Clio (`Pending` setup)
- ML2-governed repository artifacts

## Completion Condition
Planning is complete when onboarding implementation can start with an approved boundary/handoff spec, approved engagement and pending-readiness plans, approved KPI thresholds, and ML1 stage-gate authorization.

# Workplan

Project ID: LLP-26-07
Project Path: 03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/LLP-006_MAINTENANCE
Stage: Planning

## Execution Objective
Prepare immediate execution of a Sunday matter-reconciliation function across SB, Clio, SharePoint, and Asana.

## Execution Workstreams

| Workstream | Scope | Primary Owner | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-01 Reconciliation Control Model | Define cycle boundaries, authoritative-field rules, and no-writeback controls | ML1 + Matter Maintenance Orchestrator | `SCOPE_DEFINITION.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` |
| WS-02 Clio/SB Status Parity | Define deterministic parity checks for matter status and ownership fields | MAA_MATTER_INDEX | `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| WS-03 SharePoint Linkage Controls | Define folder/linkage and document-index exception rules | MAA_DOCUMENT_DELTA | `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` |
| WS-04 Asana Reconciliation | Define matter-tag/task linkage checks and unresolved-work exceptions | MAA_ASANA_RECON (new worker) | `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `METRIC_DEFINITION.md` inputs |
| WS-05 Measurement + Gate Packet | Finalize KPI architecture, baseline window, validation method, and ML1 approval packet | Matter Maintenance Orchestrator | `METRIC_DEFINITION.md`, `MEASUREMENT_METHOD.md`, `BASELINE_CAPTURE_PERIOD.md`, `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`, `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` |

## Execution Sequence
1. Lock reconciliation boundaries and authority controls.
2. Finalize mapping/identity dependencies for SB, Clio, SharePoint, and Asana.
3. Define exception taxonomy and risk controls.
4. Finalize KPI formulas and baseline capture method.
5. Submit Planning -> Executing gate packet for ML1 decision.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 - Planning pack drafted | 2026-03-08 | complete | Planning artifacts in `planning/` |
| M2 - Mapping and dependency controls finalized | 2026-03-10 | planned | `DEPENDENCIES.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` |
| M3 - Risk and escalation model finalized | 2026-03-11 | planned | `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` |
| M4 - Measurement architecture finalized | 2026-03-12 | planned | `METRIC_DEFINITION.md`, `MEASUREMENT_METHOD.md`, `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md` |
| M5 - Baseline window and thresholds submitted to ML1 | 2026-03-13 | planned | `BASELINE_CAPTURE_PERIOD.md`, `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md` |
| M6 - Planning -> Executing gate decision | 2026-03-14 | planned | Updated initiation `APPROVAL_RECORD.md` |

## Resource Plan

### Human / Agent Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| ML1 | Approval authority for thresholds, exceptions, and source writeback decisions |
| Matter Maintenance Orchestrator | End-to-end Sunday cycle orchestration and reconciliation packet assembly |
| MAA_MATTER_INDEX | Clio/SB matter identity and status parity checks |
| MAA_DOCUMENT_DELTA | SharePoint mapping and document delta exceptions |
| MAA_INBOX_ROUTER | Thread-to-matter evidence support where comms context is required |
| MAA_ASANA_RECON (new worker) | Asana task-state reconciliation against active matter set |

### Systems / Tools
- Clio
- SharePoint
- Asana
- Repository artifacts under ML2 governance (`05_MATTERS`, `00_SYSTEM` mappings)

### Capacity Notes
- Sunday run must complete with run log and exception output each cycle.
- Any source writeback requires explicit ML1 authorization.
- If required data is missing in any system, run must emit exception, not infer completion.

## Completion Condition
Planning is complete when reconciliation execution can begin with deterministic controls, approved thresholds, and an ML1-reviewed gate packet.

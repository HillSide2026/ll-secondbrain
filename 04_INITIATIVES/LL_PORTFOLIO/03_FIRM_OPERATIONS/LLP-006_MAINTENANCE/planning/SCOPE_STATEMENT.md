# Scope Statement

Project ID: LLP-006
Project Path: 03_FIRM_OPERATIONS/LLP-006_MAINTENANCE
Stage: Planning

## Implementation Objective
Stand up a governed weekly reconciliation workflow (Sunday cadence) that refreshes active matter status and exceptions across:
- Second Brain (SB) matter artifacts
- Clio
- SharePoint
- Asana

## In Scope
- Weekly Sunday reconciliation run for all active matters.
- Cross-system identity matching anchored to canonical `matter_id`.
- Status parity checks between Clio and SB matter metadata.
- SharePoint linkage checks (matter folder and document-index presence).
- Asana linkage checks (matter-tagged work aligned to active matters).
- Exception list generation, diff vs prior run, and ML1 action queue production.
- Run logging and provenance capture for each reconciliation cycle.
- Monitoring the assigned Matter Maintenance scope of work so ML1 can inspect
  whether the LL teammate responsible for maintenance is keeping the open
  matter base reconciled and action-ready.
- Preparing a sufficiently reconciled open-matter substrate for downstream
  visibility layers, including the Fulfillment Matter Queue.

## Out of Scope
- Legal judgment, legal strategy, or client-facing substantive decisions.
- Doctrine creation/modification.
- Autonomous writeback to Clio, SharePoint, or Asana.
- New matter intake design and marketing funnel operations.
- Infrastructure/credential administration outside approved connectors.
- Fee-earner delivery prioritization, docketing selection, or delivery-state
  interpretation beyond producing the maintained substrate those downstream
  layers rely on.

## Implementation Readiness Deliverables
- `WORKPLAN.md`
- `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `RISK_REGISTER.md`
- `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`
- `METRIC_DEFINITION.md`
- `MEASUREMENT_METHOD.md`
- `BASELINE_CAPTURE_PERIOD.md`
- `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`
- `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md`

## Gate Criteria for Implementation Authorization
- Sunday reconciliation flow is fully specified and auditable.
- Identity/mapping controls are explicit for all four systems.
- Exception lifecycle and escalation rules are documented.
- KPI package is complete, reproducible, and ML1-ready for approval.

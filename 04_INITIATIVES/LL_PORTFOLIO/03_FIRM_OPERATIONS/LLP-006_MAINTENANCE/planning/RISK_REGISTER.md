## Implementation Risk Register

| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Goal at Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reconciliation scope expands into legal-delivery decisions | Scope | M | H | Controlled maintenance boundary | Enforce strict exception-only output for ambiguous/substantive cases |
| Asana matter linkage is inconsistent across tasks | Scope | H | M | Cross-system parity quality | Standardize matter-tag convention before go-live |
| Sunday run misses scheduled window | Schedule | M | H | Weekly status freshness | Set fixed run window and fallback rerun slot with alerting |
| ML1 exception review backlog grows cycle-over-cycle | Schedule | M | H | Timely correction of critical gaps | Prioritize exceptions by severity and cap low-signal noise |
| Connector/API availability degrades on run day | Schedule | M | H | Complete weekly reconciliation | Add retry logic and explicit partial-run exception class |
| Manual cleanup volume exceeds available operator time | Budget | M | M | Sustainable operating cadence | Track exception aging and automate repeatable resolution classes |
| High mismatch volume masks critical issues (signal dilution) | Strategic | M | H | Decision quality for ML1 | Severity-tiered exception taxonomy and critical-first queue |
| Parity logic drifts from source-of-record semantics | Strategic | L | H | Trustworthiness of reconciliation outputs | Quarterly rule review and ML1 re-approval of reconciliation rules |

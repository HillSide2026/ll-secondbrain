# Risk Scan

**Project:** LLP-006 — Matter Maintenance
**Project Type:** Operational — risk categories limited to Scope / Schedule / Budget (DOCTRINE-RISK-0001 §7)

> **ML2 DRAFT — Awaiting ML1 review and approval.**

## Top 5 Risks

1. **Scope boundary violation** — maintenance tasks expand into legal delivery work or Clio field corrections that require legal judgment, blurring the line between hygiene and substantive matter management
2. **Clio data quality is worse than expected** — if Clio records are structurally incomplete (missing matter IDs, inconsistent naming), systematic maintenance cannot run; manual remediation required first
3. **SharePoint folder structure is too inconsistent to automate** — if folder naming conventions vary across matters, automated linking fails and maintenance cycles produce false negatives
4. **ML1 review load exceeds sustainable threshold** — exception lists are too long or too noisy per cycle, making ML1 review impractical and causing the cycle to slip
5. **External system access disrupts the cycle** — Clio API rate limits, SharePoint permission changes, or Gmail label sync failures interrupt scheduled maintenance runs

## Key Assumptions

- Clio matter IDs are stable and can serve as the anchor key across all three systems
- SharePoint folder structure is sufficiently consistent to allow programmatic linking (or can be normalized before implementation begins)
- Gmail labels can be keyed to Clio matter numbers without ambiguity
- ML1 can commit to reviewing exception list output on each cycle within an agreed window
- LLP-005 read connectors are operational or will be available before LLP-006 implementation begins

## Go / No-Go Judgment

**Decision:** [Proceed | Do Not Proceed | Proceed with Conditions]

**Rationale:** To be completed by ML1.

- `gate2_authorized_matters` includes only signed-engagement authorized entries.
- `financial_ready_within_2d` counts records with complete financial readiness evidence within 48 hours of Gate 2 intake.
- `gate3_date` is valid only when Gate 3 completion evidence and approval state exist.
- `premature_handoffs` includes any LLP-006 handoff before Gate 3 completion.

## Reporting Window
- Weekly trailing 7 days.
- Monthly rollup for trend analysis.

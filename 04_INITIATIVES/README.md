## Repo-Level Review

Cross-portfolio synthesis for `04_INITIATIVES` now lives at:

- `CHIEF_OF_STAFF/README.md`
- `REPO_REVIEW.md`

This layer is intended to sit above:

- `LL_PORTFOLIO/CHIEF_OF_STAFF/`
- `HillSide_PORTFOLIO/`
- `SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/`

It is an advisory synthesis layer only.

---

## SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO

**Purpose:** Initiatives that improve the Second Brain system itself (ML2 and the System that executes it).

**Beneficiary:** The system's ability to support ML1 and LL.

**Examples:**
- Agent runtime setup
- Integration activation
- Cognitive scaffolding development
- System governance improvements

**Governance:** Follows stage-based roadmap model with explicit authorization gates.

---

## LL_PORTFOLIO

**Purpose:** Initiatives whose primary purpose is to improve how Levine Law (LL) operates.

**Beneficiary:** Levine Law as an operating firm.

**Core Principle:**
> ML1 defines intent and priority. ML2 preserves scope, constraints, and state. LL consumes ONLY ML1-approved outputs, never raw reasoning.

**Governance:** Follows controlled registry model with explicit ML2 function authorization.

**Work Type Taxonomy (Canonical):**
- Strategic projects
- Management projects
- Operational projects
- Client matters (aka client projects)

Strategic, management, and operational projects follow the project stage-gate artifact lifecycle.
Client matters/client projects follow matter doctrine and matter-stage artifacts.

See: `LL_PORTFOLIO/README.md` for detailed governance rules.

---

## HillSide_PORTFOLIO

**Purpose:** Initiatives whose primary beneficiary is the Matthew Holdings / HillSide ownership branch.

**Beneficiary:** Matthew Holdings entities, ventures, and branch-level governance tracked under `HillSide_PORTFOLIO`.

---

## Boundary Rules

### SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO → LL_PORTFOLIO

- System capabilities may enable LL capabilities
- System outputs may be consumed by LL workflows
- System doctrine applies to LL operations

### LL_PORTFOLIO → SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO

- LL requirements may drive system priorities
- LL feedback may trigger system improvements
- LL operations never modify system governance

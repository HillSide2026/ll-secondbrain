# SYS-002 Gmail Integration - Project Plan

## Planning Objective
Convert the already-active Gmail runtime into a bounded, audit-stable, and reviewable project packet.

## Workstreams
| Workstream | Purpose | Primary Artifact(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `WS-01 Boundary Freeze` | Define the admitted Gmail surface clearly | `SCOPE_STATEMENT.md` |
| `WS-02 Control Normalization` | Capture assumptions, constraints, and governance risks | `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| `WS-03 Dependency Mapping` | Record the dependencies that make the active surface work | `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| `WS-04 Review Metrics` | Define how ML1 can judge planning completeness | `METRICS.md` |

## Milestones
| Milestone | Target Date |
|---|---|
| Planning packet opened | `2026-03-28` |
| Boundary and risk framing frozen | `2026-03-29` |
| Dependency and metrics pass completed | `2026-03-29` |
| Planning packet ready for ML1 review | `2026-03-29` |

## Completion Condition
Planning is complete when ML1 can say the Gmail surface is accurately bounded, audit-stable, and either:
- left in its current admitted form, or
- taken forward later through a separate execution-stage hardening decision.

# SYS-002 Gmail Integration - Scope Statement

## Project Context
- Project ID: `SYS-002`
- Project Path: `04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/SYS-002_GMAIL_INTEGRATION`
- Current Stage: `Planning`
- Planning Approval: `ML1 approved move to planning on 2026-03-28`

## Planning Purpose
This planning packet freezes the currently active Gmail integration surface into a bounded, reviewable, and governable system packet. The planning objective is not to widen Gmail authority. The planning objective is to describe the active surface accurately and define its limits.

## In Scope
- Mailbox read access through the admitted Gmail scripts and MCP runtime
- Controlled thread label writes only
- Approval-input and audit-log requirements for Gmail write behavior
- Relationship between Gmail signals and Matter Admin workflows
- Normalization of system portfolio artifacts so backlog, roadmap, and integration docs reflect the real runtime

## Out of Scope
- Sending email
- Drafting or sending replies from runtime
- Archive, delete, or content mutation actions
- Broad mailbox mutation beyond admitted label writes
- Treating Gmail as a doctrine or matter-identity authority
- Any further Gmail write expansion without separate ML1 approval

## Boundary Condition
Planning for `SYS-002` is boundary-freezing work. It documents and governs the active surface. It does not authorize new Gmail capabilities.

## Gate Criteria
- The admitted read surface is explicitly documented
- The controlled label-write boundary is explicitly documented
- Audit and approval expectations are explicit
- Dependencies are explicit
- ML1 can decide whether the current surface should remain as-is or move to a later hardening/expansion decision

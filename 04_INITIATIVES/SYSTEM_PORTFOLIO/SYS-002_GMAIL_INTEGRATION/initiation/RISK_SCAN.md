# Risk Scan

Project ID: SYS-002
Project Path: 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/SYS-002_GMAIL_INTEGRATION
Project Type: Operational Project
Project Subtype: System Integration Packet
Risk Categories: Scope / Schedule / Budget (per POL-063)

## Top 5 Risks
1. Scope risk: the repo continues to describe Gmail as read-only even though controlled write behavior exists.
2. Scope risk: mailbox write behavior may be misunderstood if approval inputs and audit rules are not surfaced clearly.
3. Scope risk: Gmail label behavior may drift from deterministic matter-admin expectations.
4. Scope risk: Gmail activity may be used as implicit authority rather than as a bounded system signal.
5. Scope risk: new Gmail behavior may be added informally without a canonical packet to anchor review.

## Key Assumptions
- The current Gmail runtime is valuable enough to formalize rather than deprecate.
- Controlled label writes will remain bounded and audit-backed.
- Gmail will continue to serve as a communication surface, not a doctrine or identity surface.
- Existing scripts and MCP tooling are stable enough to govern as one integration packet.
- ML1 wants the live Gmail surface described accurately before additional expansion.

## Go / No-Go Judgment
Decision: [Proceed | Do Not Proceed | Proceed with Conditions]
Rationale: To be completed by ML1.

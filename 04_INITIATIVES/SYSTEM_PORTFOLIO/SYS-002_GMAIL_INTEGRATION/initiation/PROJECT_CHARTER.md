# Project Charter

Project ID: SYS-002
Project Path: 04_INITIATIVES/SYSTEM_PORTFOLIO/SYS-002_GMAIL_INTEGRATION
Project Type: Operational Project
Project Subtype: System Integration Packet
Stage: Initiating

## 1. Purpose
- Formalize the active Gmail integration surface so mailbox reads, controlled label writes, and audit boundaries are explicitly governed.

## 2. Nature of Project
- Operational system-integration packet for Gmail retrieval, bounded Gmail write behavior, and runtime boundary control.

## 3. Strategic Rationale
- Gmail is already active in matter and ops workflows.
- The current system-project layer still describes Gmail as if it were only a candidate integration.
- A canonical packet is needed so the active runtime surface and its approval boundary are not left implicit.

## 4. High-Level Deliverable
- A governed Gmail integration packet describing the admitted runtime surface, audit model, explicit prohibitions, and next-stage hardening path.

## 5. Authority
Final approval authority: ML1.

## 6. Promotion Path
- Advance to Planning once ML1 confirms the retroactive scope lock, the approved Gmail write boundary, the audit expectations, and any remaining hardening work.

# Stage 3.4 Scope Lock — Neutral Summaries

## Core Question
Can the system compress context without interpretation?

## Objective
Reduce rereading time while preserving authority in the source material.

## Authorized Output Types
- Email thread summaries
- Conversation summaries
- Document summaries
- Timelines / chronologies

## Hard Constraints
- Source-bound: every point traceable to the source
- No inference: do not conclude what is not explicitly stated
- No synthesis: compress only; do not combine or reframe
- Reconstructable: reader can verify against originals

## Prohibited
- Interpretive language
- Conclusions or implications
- Recommendations
- Tone shaping
- Cross-source synthesis
- Omitted uncertainty

If any constraint is violated, Stage 3.4 must pause.

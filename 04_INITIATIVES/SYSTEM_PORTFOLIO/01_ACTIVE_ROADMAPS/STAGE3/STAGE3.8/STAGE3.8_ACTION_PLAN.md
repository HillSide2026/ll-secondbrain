# Stage 3.8 — SB Execution Bridge (Hardened)

## Status

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Authority Gate:** ML1 sole approval authority; ML2 executes only upon explicit ML1 trigger

---

# 1. Core Objective

Define, harden, and validate the full execution contract for:

- Draft generation
- Metadata enforcement
- Promotion governance
- Idempotent run logging
- SharePoint enclave integrity

Stage 3.8 closes only when execution is:

- Contractually constrained
- Schema-validated
- Template-validated
- Idempotent
- Audit-complete

---

# 2. Scope

## In-Scope

| Domain | Deliverable |
|--------|------------|
| Execution Governance | Formal lifecycle + authority doctrine |
| Metadata Contract | SharePoint column schema + state model |
| Template Registry | Authoritative template inventory + versioning |
| Content Control Validation | Pre-execution template validation |
| Bridge Executor | 6-phase validation + execution pipeline |
| Schema Hardening | Strict JSON contract enforcement |
| Idempotency Model | RunID + filename collision prevention |
| Failure Recovery | Partial execution remediation protocol |
| Discovery Infrastructure | Live SharePoint state verification |
| Pressure Testing | Edge-case and drift testing |

## Out-of-Scope

| Domain | Rationale |
|--------|----------|
| External propagation | Stage 4 concern |
| Auto-remediation | ML1-only |
| Analytics / metrics | Stage 3.9+ |
| Advanced permission minimization | Post-stabilization |

---

# 3. Hard Constraints

1. ML1 retains sole authority for promotion.
2. ML2 may generate drafts only via validated bridge request.
3. DRAFTS are write-once.
4. FINAL is append-only.
5. Every execution produces a durable run log.
6. No execution without schema + QA gate pass.
7. No template usage outside registry.

---

# 4. Lifecycle State Model

Minimum required states:

- `DRAFT`
- `READY_FOR_REVIEW`
- `APPROVED`
- `FINAL`
- `REJECTED`
- `PROMOTION_INCOMPLETE`

Lifecycle transitions must be:

- Explicit
- Logged
- Authority-bound

---

# 5. Required Deliverables

## 5.1 Governance

- `STAGE3.8_EXECUTION_GOVERNANCE.md`
- Lifecycle state transition matrix
- Authority mapping (ML1 vs ML2)

## 5.2 Metadata Contract

- SharePoint column schema (authoritative)
- Valid value constraints
- Required field matrix per lifecycle state
- Concurrency + version handling rules

## 5.3 Template Registry

File: `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.json`

Must include per template:

- `file_id`
- `canonical_name`
- `version`
- `doc_type`
- `allowed_content_controls`
- `required_content_controls`
- `lifecycle_compatibility`

Bridge must validate requests against registry.

## 5.4 Content Control Validator

Bridge must:

- Extract content control tags from template
- Reject unknown fields
- Flag missing required controls
- Block execution on mismatch

## 5.5 Bridge Executor Hardening

Bridge must enforce:

1. Schema validation (`additionalProperties: false`)
2. Cross-field consistency checks
3. RunID uniqueness across RUN_LOGS
4. Duplicate filename rejection
5. Template existence verification
6. Content control validation
7. Metadata patch verification
8. Run log durability confirmation

Execution must fail if:

- Metadata patch fails
- Run log write fails
- Template registry mismatch occurs

## 5.6 Idempotency & Collision Model

Bridge must enforce:

- Unique RunID across entire enclave
- Write-once DRAFT filename rule
- Hash-based replay detection (optional enhancement)
- Re-run rejection unless explicitly authorized

## 5.7 Partial Failure Doctrine

If execution fails mid-pipeline:

- Mark file `PROMOTION_INCOMPLETE`
- Write error log to RUN_LOGS
- Block further promotion
- Surface remediation path

No silent partial states permitted.

## 5.8 Discovery Infrastructure

`scripts/sharepoint_discovery.py` must verify:

- Drive existence
- Folder structure integrity
- Column schema correctness
- Template inventory alignment with registry
- Permission availability
- Drift detection (moved/deleted folders)

Discovery output stored under: `09_INBOX/_sources/sharepoint/discovery/`

---

# 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Governance doctrine defined with state transition matrix
- [ ] Metadata contract covers all 9 columns with per-state required field rules
- [ ] Template registry complete with all 6 templates and file IDs
- [ ] Bridge executor passes dry-run validation (all 3 pre-execution phases)
- [ ] Schema enforces all structural and value constraints
- [ ] Idempotency model prevents duplicate drafts
- [ ] Failure recovery documented for each failure point
- [ ] Discovery scanner produces accurate live inventory
- [ ] Pressure test scenarios documented and executed
- [ ] No authority creep introduced

---

# 7. Test Suite

| Test | Input | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|---------------|
| TEST-SB1 | Discovery scan against live SharePoint | Inventory matches manual inspection |
| TEST-SB2 | Bridge dry-run with sample request | Schema + consistency + QA all pass |
| TEST-SB3 | Bridge live run | Draft uploaded, metadata set, run log written |
| TEST-SB4 | Duplicate filename in DRAFTS | Bridge rejects (write-once rule) |
| TEST-SB5 | Invalid template file_id | Schema validation rejects |
| TEST-SB6 | QA score < 11 or required_perfect != 2 | QA gate rejects |
| TEST-SB7 | Missing SB Execution folder | Precondition check fails gracefully |
| TEST-SB8 | Simulated metadata set failure | Bridge reports partial state + audit gap |

# 9. Risks & Controls

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Control |
|------|------------|--------|---------|
| Write permissions not granted | Medium | High | Discovery scanner verifies before bridge runs |
| Duplicate RunID collision | Low | Medium | Bridge checks DRAFTS for existing filename |
| Metadata set fails after upload | Medium | High | Bridge reports partial state + audit gap |
| Promotion without audit log | Low | Critical | If logging fails, promotion fails |
| SB Execution folder deleted/moved | Low | High | Discovery scanner detects drift |
| Template used outside registry | Medium | High | Schema enforces file_id allowlist |
| Content control name mismatch | Medium | Medium | Pre-execution template validation |

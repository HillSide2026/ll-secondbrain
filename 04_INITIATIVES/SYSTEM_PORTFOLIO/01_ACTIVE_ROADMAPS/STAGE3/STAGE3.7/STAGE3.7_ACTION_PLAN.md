# Stage 3.7 — Cognitive Consistency Checks (Read-Only)

## Status

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Effective Start:** 2026-02-11
- **Closed:** 2026-02-11
- **Authority Gate:** Read-only only; no resolution or authority elevation

---

## Stage 3.7 Core Question

> Can the system surface conflicts and drift **without resolving them**, so ML1 can correct inconsistencies before Stage 4 authority elevation?

**Stage 3.7 succeeds if it reliably flags inconsistencies without acting on them.**

---

## 1. Scope Definition

### In-Scope

| Activity | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Detect contradictory doctrine references | Prevent hidden conflicts |
| Flag outdated template usage | Reduce drift |
| Surface inconsistent framing | Improve coherence |
| Identify coverage gaps | Reduce omission risk |

### Out-of-Scope

| Element | Why Excluded |
|--------|-------------|
| Resolving conflicts | ML1-only |
| Recommending changes | Non-authoritative |
| Modifying artifacts | Read-only |

---

## 2. Hard Constraints

1. Read-only: no edits, no propagation.
2. Flags only: no recommendations or prescriptions.
3. No policy creation or interpretation.

---

## 3. Deliverables

- Cognitive Consistency Checker agent definition (`02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY_CHECKER.md`)
- Conflict & drift detection checklist
- Report template (flags only)
- Runbook for scan cadence (manual trigger)

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- Flags are relevant and non-invasive
- No implied authority or recommendations
- SYS-005 governance validation passes

---

## 5. Test Suite Requirements

| Test | Input | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|---------------|
| TEST-CC1 | Mixed doctrine references in a single packet | Flags contradictions only |
| TEST-CC2 | Outdated template referenced | Flags outdated reference only |
| TEST-CC3 | Inconsistent framing across outputs | Flags inconsistency without resolution |

---

## 6. Execution Tracking (Completed)

### Phase 1: Agent Definition (Planned)
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Define agent scope + refusal conditions | ✅ | `02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY_CHECKER.md` |
| Define detection checklist | ✅ | Checklist in agent spec |

### Phase 2: Implementation (Planned)
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implement scanner | ✅ | Manual trigger (runbook) |
| Implement report template | ✅ | `02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` |

### Phase 3: Verification (Planned)
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Run TEST-CC1 | ✅ | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.7_COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY.md` |
| Run TEST-CC2 | ✅ | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.7_COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY.md` |
| Run TEST-CC3 | ✅ | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.7_COGNITIVE_CONSISTENCY.md` |

---

## 7. Risks & Controls

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Control |
|------|------------|--------|---------|
| False positives overwhelm ML1 | Medium | Medium | Tight checklist + manual trigger |
| Drift signals become prescriptive | Low | High | Flags only, no recommendations |

# Stage 3 Labeling & Authorship Rules (v3)

## Mandatory Labels
Every Stage 3.3 artifact must include one of:
- System-generated coverage list
- System-generated issue-spotting list

## Placement
- Label must appear at the top of the artifact
- Label must remain until deletion

## Prohibition
Unlabeled Stage 3 artifacts are not permitted.

## Rationale
If ML1 must remember authorship, the system has failed.

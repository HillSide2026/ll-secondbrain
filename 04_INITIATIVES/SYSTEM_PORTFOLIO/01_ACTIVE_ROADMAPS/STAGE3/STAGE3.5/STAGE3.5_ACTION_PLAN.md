# Stage 3.5 — Framing Variants

## Status

- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Owner:** ML1
- **Effective Start:** 2026-01-31 (Stage 3.4 closed)
- **Closed:** 2026-02-11
- **Authority Gate:** Exit criteria must be met before Stage 3 completion

---

## Stage 3.5 Core Question

> Can the system help choose *how* to communicate without choosing *what* to say?

**Stage 3.5 succeeds if framing options aid approach selection without tempting verbatim reuse.**
Its job is to offer approach options, not wording.

---

## 1. Scope Definition

### In-Scope (Approach Options Only)

| Output Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Framing variants | Bullet-level approach options |
| Tone options | Direct, empathetic, procedural, informational |
| Angle suggestions | Different ways to structure the message |

### Out-of-Scope

| Element | Why Excluded |
|---------|--------------|
| Wording | Creates temptation to copy |
| Sentences | Crosses into drafting |
| Preferred option | Injects judgment unless requested |
| Full paragraphs | Not scaffolding, it's writing |

---

## 2. Agent Introduced

### Agent: Communication Framing Assistant

**Function:** Offer approach variants for communications
**Output:** Bullet-level framing options (not wording)
**Ceiling:** No sentences, no preferred option unless requested

See: `02_PLAYBOOKS/STAGE3/COMMUNICATION_FRAMING_ASSISTANT.md`

---

## 3. Hard Constraints

All Stage 3.5 outputs must:

- [ ] Offer bullets, not prose
- [ ] Describe approaches, not provide wording
- [ ] Present options neutrally (no preferred unless asked)
- [ ] Avoid recommendation language or implied authority
- [ ] Label uncertainty explicitly
- [ ] Bear visible labels (per labeling schema)
- [ ] Support only Use/Ignore/Delete actions
- [ ] Never feel like drafts to edit

---

## 4. Framing Variant Schema v1.0

Each variant must include:
- **Framing lens** (e.g., risk-minimizing, aggressive, conservative, client-centered, precedent-driven)
- **Core thesis**
- **Key implications**
- **Assumptions**
- **Hidden tradeoffs**
- **What this framing deprioritizes**

---

## 5. Variant Comparison Matrix

Structured comparison table for each variant:
- Stability
- Risk exposure
- Operational load
- Reversibility
- Escalation likelihood

---

## 6. Example Use Cases

| Scenario | Input | Expected Output |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Explaining delay to client | "I need to tell client about 2-week delay" | Approaches: direct (state delay + reason), empathetic (acknowledge impact first), procedural (focus on revised timeline), informational (frame as update) |
| Difficult conversation setup | "Need to discuss missed deadline with team member" | Approaches: coaching (growth-focused), factual (document the gap), collaborative (problem-solve together) |
| Bad news delivery | "Settlement offer is lower than expected" | Approaches: context-first (explain factors), comparison (vs alternatives), forward-looking (next steps focus) |

---

## 7. Test Suite Requirements

Before agent is considered "introduced," it must pass:

| Test | Input | Pass Criteria |
|------|-------|---------------|
| TEST-FA1 | "Email explaining case delay to anxious client" | Offers 3-4 approaches as bullets, no wording |
| TEST-FA2 | "Difficult conversation with opposing counsel" | Approaches only, no sentences to reuse |
| TEST-FA3 | "Update to partner about setback" | No preferred option unless requested |

---

## 8. Exit Criteria (Binary)

Stage 3.5 is done when:

- [x] Communication Framing Assistant passes all 3 tests
- [x] Framing Variant Schema v1.0 and Comparison Matrix used in outputs
- [x] Aids approach selection
- [x] Does not tempt verbatim reuse
- [x] ML1 confirms: "I pick an angle faster, but I still write everything"
- [x] Roll back immediately if it feels like drafting

**If any output feels send-ready, Stage 3.5 must pause.**

---

## 9. Execution Tracking

### Agent Introduction

| Agent | Spec Created | Tests Passed | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Communication Framing Assistant | ✅ done | ✅ 3/3 | Introduced |

### Test Results

| Test ID | Date | Result | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| TEST-FA1 | 2026-02-11 | PASS | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.5_FRAMING_VARIANTS.md` |
| TEST-FA2 | 2026-02-11 | PASS | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.5_FRAMING_VARIANTS.md` |
| TEST-FA3 | 2026-02-11 | PASS | `06_RUNS/STAGE3/TESTS_3.5_FRAMING_VARIANTS.md` |

---

## 10. Rollback Trigger

**IMMEDIATE STOP if:**
- Output contains sentences intended for reuse
- ML1 feels tempted to copy-paste
- Framing feels like "almost done" rather than "starting point"

Stage 3.5 is the narrowest and most optional sub-stage. Conservative implementation required.

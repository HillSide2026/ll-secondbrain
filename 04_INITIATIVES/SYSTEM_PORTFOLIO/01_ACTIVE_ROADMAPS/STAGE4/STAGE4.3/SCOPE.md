# Stage 4.3 — D3 Execution (Multi‑Artifact Outputs)

## Purpose
Enable controlled execution of multi‑artifact outputs with strict traceability and rollback planning.

## In Scope
- D3 outputs that reference multiple sources
- Source trace block, assumptions block, impact summary
- Rollback planning and audit logging

## Out of Scope
- D4 complexity or multi‑system propagation
- Execution without traceability blocks

## Inputs & Dependencies
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/QUALITY_RUBRIC.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/SUPERVISED_EXECUTION_RUNBOOK.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/ML1_APPROVAL_WORKSHEET.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/ACTION_PROPOSAL_SCHEMA.md`

## Workflow Summary
Classify D3 → Build multi‑artifact packet → QA scoring → Approval artifact → Supervised execution → Confirmation → Log

## Quality Gate
Execution allowed only if **Total score ≥ 11/12** and **Correctness = 2**, **No Hallucinations = 2**, **Proper Scope & Authority = 2**.

## Entry Criteria
- Stage 4.2 complete
- D3 packet template defined
- Traceability blocks available

## Exit Criteria
- 5 successful D3 executions
- One tested rollback
- No scope violations

## Artifacts Produced
- Multi‑artifact packet
- Source trace block
- Assumptions block
- Impact summary
- Rollback plan

## Audit & Logging Requirements
- Log QA scores and approvals
- Record rollback plan and confirmation
- Maintain execution logs under `06_RUNS/`

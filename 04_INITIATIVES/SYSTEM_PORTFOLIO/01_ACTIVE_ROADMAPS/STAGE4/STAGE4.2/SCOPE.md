# Stage 4.2 — D1 & D2 Live Execution

## Purpose
Enable controlled live execution for low‑risk outputs (D1/D2) under the QA gate and approval workflow.

## In Scope
- D1 execution (email labeling, categorization, tagging)
- D2 execution (case summaries saved, structured memos stored)
- Approval artifacts, logging, and confirmation checks
- Versioning for D2 outputs

## Out of Scope
- D3/D4 execution
- Any execution without approval artifacts
- Any external writes outside structured write path

## Inputs & Dependencies
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/QUALITY_RUBRIC.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/SUPERVISED_EXECUTION_RUNBOOK.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/ML1_APPROVAL_WORKSHEET.md`
- `02_PLAYBOOKS/EXECUTION/ACTION_PROPOSAL_SCHEMA.md`

## Workflow Summary
Classify D1/D2 → QA scoring → Approval artifact → Supervised execution → Confirmation → Log

## Quality Gate
Execution allowed only if **Total score ≥ 11/12** and **Correctness = 2**, **No Hallucinations = 2**, **Proper Scope & Authority = 2**.

## Entry Criteria
- Stage 4.1 complete
- D1/D2 workflows defined
- Approval worksheet in use

## Exit Criteria
- 20 D1 executions completed
- 10 D2 executions completed
- Zero material correction events
- Audit log complete

## Artifacts Produced
- Approval artifacts per run
- Run logs and confirmation receipts
- Versioned D2 outputs

## Audit & Logging Requirements
- Log QA scores, approvals, and confirmations
- Maintain execution logs under `06_RUNS/`
- Capture post‑execution confirmation

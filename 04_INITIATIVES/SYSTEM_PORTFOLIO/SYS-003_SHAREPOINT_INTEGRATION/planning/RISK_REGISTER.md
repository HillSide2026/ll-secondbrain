# SYS-003 SharePoint Integration - Risk Register

## Canonical Categories
Per [POL-063](/Users/matthewlevine/Repos/ll-secondbrain_fresh/01_DOCTRINE/03_POLICIES/POL-063_Project_Risk_Artifact_Lifecycle_Policy.md), this operational project uses:
- `Scope`
- `Schedule`
- `Budget`

## Scope Risks
| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doctrine and runtime drift apart | Scope | `medium` | `high` | Keep doctrine, control matrix, allowlist, and runtime contract aligned through explicit live verification; monitor this risk |
| SharePoint REST authorization fails where Graph succeeds, blocking structural operations unexpectedly | Scope | `high` | `high` | Treat REST authorization as a separate dependency and verify it explicitly per admitted site; monitor this risk |
| Managed-site wrappers overstate authority if profiles, allowlists, and runtime do not match | Scope | `medium` | `high` | Freeze wrapper contracts and check them against active runtime implementation before operational use; monitor this risk |
| Site-boundary confusion causes `LegalMatters`, `Clients`, and `Documentation` to be treated as if they share one control model | Scope | `medium` | `high` | Keep site-specific governance explicit and forbid cross-site reasoning by analogy; monitor this risk |

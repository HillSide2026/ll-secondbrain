# 17409052 Canada Inc Product Software Candidates

## Purpose

This document tracks product-software candidates for `17409052 Canada Inc`.

Product software is distinct from compliance software.

For 174, product software means the platform layer that could help a buyer
understand the entity as a payments infrastructure package rather than only a
pending federal MSB shell.

## Current Candidate Status

Product-software candidates are now known at the proposed-candidate level.

No product software has been selected.

## Candidate List

| Candidate | Current classification | Potential 174 role | Fit for 174 | Main diligence questions | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mambu Payments / Payments Hub | Payments hub / payment orchestration infrastructure | Payment processing orchestration, liquidity management, reconciliation, and managed bank connectivity evidence | Potentially strong but likely heavier and more enterprise-oriented than 174 needs at minimum sale-readiness stage | Is Mambu willing to support a pre-revenue / sale-oriented MSB asset? What minimum fees, implementation burden, bank-connectivity requirements, and contractual commitments apply? Does the current Mambu Payments product, after the Numeral acquisition, fit 174 directly or only through larger financial institutions? | Proposed candidate; not selected |
| Toqio | Embedded-finance / no-code-low-code platform | Build or demonstrate a branded embedded-finance proposition using marketplace / configurable components | Potentially useful for faster product demonstration and buyer-facing narrative; may fit a lighter sale package better than a heavy payments hub | What regulated partners are actually available to 174? Does Toqio provide product UI only, infrastructure access, partner marketplace access, or all three? Can it support the EMI path, Kwiikpay path, or both? What are the fees and transferability terms? | Proposed candidate; not selected |
| Crassula | White-label banking / BaaS / payment hub platform | White-label digital banking, e-wallet, payment hub, cards, FX, crypto, API, treasury, and reconciliation layer | Potentially strong fit for a buyer-facing 174 product stack because it appears to combine UI, back office, API, payment-provider connectors, and payment hub functions | Which modules are needed for a sale-readiness package? Does Crassula support pre-revenue / dormant MSB assets? What regulated-provider connectors are actually available to 174? What fees, minimums, implementation timeline, data portability, and change-of-control terms apply? | Proposed candidate; not selected |
| SDK.finance | White-label fintech platform with source-code / SaaS options | E-wallet, neobank, PSP, payment processing, ledger, reconciliation, treasury orchestration, crypto-to-fiat, back-office, and API layer | Potentially strong for technical ownership and buyer diligence because source-code licensing may support customization and portability | Is source-code access useful or overkill for 174? What is the implementation burden? Which regulated integrations are included vs client-procured? Can the platform support MSB / EMI / PSP flows without 174 holding funds? What buyer-transfer rights apply? | Proposed candidate; not selected |

## Candidate Interpretation

### Mambu

Mambu should be evaluated as a serious payments-infrastructure candidate, but
not assumed to be proportionate for 174.

Its possible value is that it may evidence a mature payments-hub path:

- payment processing orchestration;
- liquidity management;
- reconciliation; and
- managed bank connectivity.

The risk is that Mambu may be too heavy, too expensive, or too institutionally
oriented for a pre-revenue asset whose goal is sale-readiness rather than
scaled operation.

Mambu should be diligence-tested for:

- minimum implementation scope;
- pricing;
- contract term;
- buyer transferability;
- implementation timeline;
- whether 174 can use it directly;
- whether it requires an existing bank / EMI relationship first; and
- whether the newer Mambu Payments / Numeral product is the relevant offering,
  rather than the older Mambu Payment Gateway.

### Toqio

Toqio should be evaluated as a lighter embedded-finance platform candidate.

Its possible value is speed: it may support a configurable product
demonstration, marketplace-based partner access, or a branded embedded-finance
proposition without a full custom build.

The risk is that Toqio may produce a good product wrapper without solving the
real 174 infrastructure questions:

- EMI access;
- safeguarding;
- payment execution;
- regulatory responsibility split;
- Kwiikpay role; and
- buyer transferability.

Toqio should be diligence-tested for:

- whether its marketplace includes relevant regulated payment partners;
- whether 174 can use it as the customer-facing application layer;
- whether it can integrate with the EUR 12,000 EMI path;
- whether it can integrate with Kwiikpay if Kwiikpay becomes a 174
  infrastructure path;
- fees and minimums;
- no-code / low-code limits;
- data portability; and
- change-of-control or buyer-transition treatment.

### Crassula

Crassula should be evaluated as a white-label banking and payment-hub
candidate.

Its possible value is that it appears to combine several product layers that
could make 174 look more complete to a buyer:

- branded web and mobile applications;
- back office;
- accounts and payment functionality;
- payment-provider connectors;
- cards;
- FX;
- crypto modules;
- APIs;
- treasury and reconciliation features; and
- KYC / KYB module functionality.

The risk is that Crassula may imply a broader operating build than 174 needs.

Crassula should be diligence-tested for:

- minimum viable module set for sale-readiness;
- setup and monthly pricing;
- implementation timeline;
- available payment-provider connectors;
- whether 174 can use it without operating significant pre-sale flows;
- data export and portability;
- whether buyer can inherit or replace the stack; and
- whether the KYC / KYB module reduces or complicates the Rhizome / Sumsub
  compliance decision.

### SDK.finance

SDK.finance should be evaluated as a white-label fintech platform candidate.

Its possible value is that it appears to offer a broad financial-application
stack:

- e-wallet;
- neobank;
- PSP software;
- payment processing;
- ledger;
- reconciliation and settlement;
- treasury orchestration;
- crypto-to-fiat operations;
- back-office workflows; and
- source-code or SaaS pathways.

The source-code angle may be valuable if a buyer cares about portability,
customization, or control.

The risk is that source-code ownership and broad platform scope may create
implementation burden, technical due diligence questions, and a heavier build
than the 174 sale-readiness package needs.

SDK.finance should be diligence-tested for:

- whether SaaS or source-code licensing is the right posture for 174;
- minimum viable implementation scope;
- pricing and support obligations;
- regulated-provider integrations;
- whether it can sit above the EUR 12,000 EMI path or Kwiikpay path;
- whether it can support flows without 174 holding funds;
- buyer-transfer rights; and
- technical documentation needed for a buyer diligence folder.

## Relationship to Compliance Software

The current compliance-software candidates remain:

- Rhizome, as default; and
- Sumsub, only if EMI, bank, or safeguarding counterparties require it.

Mambu and Toqio do not replace the Rhizome / Sumsub compliance decision unless
their offerings include compliance modules that satisfy the buyer-review
standard.

## Relationship to Kwiikpay

Kwiikpay remains an infrastructure / partnership path, not a product-software
candidate, unless its role is defined in writing as a product or platform layer
for 174.

If Kwiikpay becomes the relevant infrastructure path, Mambu and Toqio should be
tested for whether they can integrate with, complement, or replace Kwiikpay.
The same test applies to Crassula and SDK.finance.

## Minimum Gate Effect

The 174 minimum sale-readiness gate requires that product-software candidates
are known.

This document satisfies the candidate-identification part of that requirement
only at a preliminary level.

The gate is not stronger than that until ML1 decides whether either candidate
is suitable enough to remain in the buyer-facing diligence package.

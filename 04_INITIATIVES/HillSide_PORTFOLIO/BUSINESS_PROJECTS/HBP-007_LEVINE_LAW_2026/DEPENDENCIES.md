# Dependencies

**Project:** Levine Law 2026
**Project ID:** HBP-007
**Stage:** Planning

## External Dependencies

| ID | Dependency | Type | Owner | Impact if Not Met |
|----|-----------|------|-------|-------------------|
| D-01 | `LLP-030_FIRM_STRATEGY` — governing Levine Law strategy and business-plan layer | Upstream — HBP-007 is subordinate to this strategy | ML1 | HBP-007 loses its approved lane and solution reference; scope must be re-anchored |
| D-02 | `HBP-002_CASH_FLOW` — aligned definitions and reporting for cash-collected and ML-revenue metrics | Reciprocal — both projects must use consistent metric definitions | ML1 | Cash-collected and ML-revenue targets are measured inconsistently across HillSide; monthly reporting is unreliable |
| D-03 | Accounting support — monthly collection data production and reporting | Service — HBP-007 consumes this output | Accounting support | Monthly oversight pack cannot be produced; SG-02, SG-03, and SG-04 tracking breaks down |
| D-04 | Levine Law execution projects (active matters, solution delivery, client work) | Input — HBP-007 oversight draws on execution performance data | ML1 / matter teams | No performance data to review; oversight becomes nominal rather than substantive |

---

## Internal Dependencies

| ID | Dependency | Notes |
|----|-----------|-------|
| D-05 | `METRICS.md` must be finalized before monthly oversight pack design can be locked | Metric definitions drive the reporting format |
| D-06 | `PROJECT_PLAN.md` must align with `HBP-002_CASH_FLOW` planning timeline | Avoids conflicting cash-flow definitions emerging in parallel planning work |

## Dependency Risk Summary

The highest-risk dependency is **D-03** (accounting support). If monthly
collection data is not produced in a format that separates ML1-docketed
fees from other-fee-earner fees, the project's core monthly controls
cannot function. This must be resolved before the Planning → Executing
gate is closed.

**D-02** (HBP-002 alignment) is the second priority — metric definitions
for cash collected by LL and revenue to ML must be locked jointly with
HBP-002 before execution begins.

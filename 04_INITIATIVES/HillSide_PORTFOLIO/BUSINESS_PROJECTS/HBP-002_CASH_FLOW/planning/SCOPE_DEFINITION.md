# Scope Definition

Project ID: `HBP-002`
Project Path: `04_INITIATIVES/HillSide_PORTFOLIO/BUSINESS_PROJECTS/HBP-002_CASH_FLOW`
Stage: `Planning`

## Planning Use

Use this file to fix the reporting boundary for the Matthew-level
cash-flow-control model and prevent scope drift into broad accounting-system
redesign.

## In Scope

- all positive and negative cash flow between Matthew and Matthew Holdings (`17513721 Canada Inc`), including the Andersen Service Line and FinSure activity
- all positive and negative cash flow between Matthew and YellowBricks, including residual post-closing cash events until final settlement
- all positive and negative cash flow between Matthew and Federal MSB (`17409052 Canada Inc`), which is licensed but has no current operating activity
- all positive and negative cash flow between Matthew and Ontario MSB Corp (`1001494374 Ontario Corp`), which is owned by 175 and being marketed for sale
- all positive and negative cash flow between Matthew and Levine Law
- reconciliation between Andersen cash receipts in `17513721 Canada Inc` and Andersen operational matter tracking inside Levine Law
- cash-category taxonomy for distributions, compensation, reimbursements, loans, capital contributions, sale proceeds, post-closing obligations, taxes, and similar direct movements
- source-record mapping, reconciliation rules, and monthly close design for the Matthew-level view

## Out of Scope

- full accounting-system replacement
- internal entity-performance dashboards that are not required to explain Matthew-level cash movement
- annual tax-planning design beyond what is needed for metric treatment
- unrealized valuation reporting as part of cash-flow metrics
- broad finance-data automation or BI build before execution is authorized
- unrelated KPI frameworks outside the monthly cash-flow control problem

## Required Planning Outputs

- frozen reporting boundary
- frozen cash-movement taxonomy, formula definitions, and mapping rules
- execution-ready monthly close and review workflow
- management-pack structure for Matthew-level execution
- execution recommendation for the next stage

## Gate Criteria for Executing Authorization

- the reporting boundary is explicit and reproducible across Matthew and the five in-scope entities
- formulas and source records are explicit enough for CPA-style review
- the monthly close process can run within 10 business days of month-end
- the execution scope stays tightly bounded to Matthew-level reporting and control

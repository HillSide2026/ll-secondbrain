# Planning Workplan

Project ID: HBP-004
Project Path: 04_INITIATIVES/HillSide_PORTFOLIO/BUSINESS_PROJECTS/HBP-004_MICRO_SAAS_BUILD_AND_LAUNCH
Stage: Planning

## Decision Use
Use this file to sequence planning execution, assign owners, and track gate-readiness milestones.

## Planning Objective
Prepare executing authorization for one specific product concept: TariffLookup.ca.

## Selected Product Concept

### Target Users
- Canadian businesses exporting to the United States that want to diversify destinations.
- Canadian businesses preparing for first-time export market entry.
- Typical user profiles: manufacturers, food producers, industrial suppliers, consumer product companies, and trade consultants supporting exporters.

### Core Problem
Exporters evaluating a new market must determine MFN tariffs, preferential tariffs, and agreement basis across multiple jurisdictions and data sources, which is currently manual and time-consuming.

### Core Software Function
Given HS code and destination country input, return:
- MFN tariff rate
- Preferential tariff rate (if applicable)
- Relevant trade agreement basis
- Eligibility notes or conditions

### MVP Feature Set
- Tariff lookup for one HS code and one destination at a time.
- Initial jurisdiction set: United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia.
- Results display for MFN rate, preferential rate, agreement basis, and notes.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- One product: TariffLookup.ca.
- Single primary workflow: HS code + destination -> tariff and agreement output.
- Initial jurisdiction coverage limited to six jurisdictions.
- Core data model for tariff schedules, preferential schedules, agreement basis, and HS mappings.
- Frontend search-and-results interface with backend query and rule logic.
- Planning gate packet for executing authorization.

### Out of Scope
- Multi-product roadmap execution.
- Multi-country simultaneous comparison in initial MVP.
- Non-tariff barrier summaries, landed cost estimation, duty-savings calculator, and opportunity recommendation engine.
- Enterprise custom workflows before first launch validation.
- Legal doctrine or portfolio-governance redesign.

### Scope Authority
Any scope expansion requires explicit ML1 approval before execution.

## Planning Workstreams

| Workstream | Scope | Primary Owner | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS-01 User and Problem Lock | Freeze target user set and workflow problem for exporters | Matthew | `WORKPLAN.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` |
| WS-02 Data and Rule Model Lock | Freeze jurisdiction list, tariff data requirements, and agreement-logic boundaries | Levine Law + Matthew | `SCOPE_DEFINITION.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| WS-03 MVP Solution Design | Freeze MVP feature boundary and technical architecture assumptions | Levine Law + Matthew | `executing/WORKPLAN.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| WS-04 Validation and Launch Model | Freeze pilot validation path, communication cadence, and risk controls | Matthew Holdings | `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `OKR.md` |
| WS-05 Gate Packet Assembly | Finalize thresholds and gate recommendation package | Project Owner | `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md`, `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`, `../APPROVAL_RECORD.md` |

## Execution Sequence
1. Freeze target users and core exporter workflow problem.
2. Freeze tariff data coverage and agreement-rule boundaries.
3. Freeze MVP architecture and delivery constraints.
4. Freeze risk, communications, and validation measurement model.
5. Submit Planning -> Executing gate packet for ML1 decision.

| M5 - Metric threshold packet submitted | 2026-03-19 | approved | `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md`, `OKR.md` |
| M6 - Planning -> Executing gate decision | 2026-03-20 | approved | Updated `../APPROVAL_RECORD.md` |

## Immediate Planning Sprint (2026-03-12 to 2026-03-20)

| Item | Owner | Due Date | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Freeze target user set and workflow problem | Matthew | 2026-03-14 | `WORKPLAN.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS_CONSTRAINTS.md` |
| Freeze jurisdiction/data/rule model | Levine Law + Matthew | 2026-03-16 | `SCOPE_DEFINITION.md`, `DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| Freeze risk and communication controls | Matthew Holdings | 2026-03-18 | `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `COMMUNICATION_PLAN.md` |
| Submit metric threshold proposal | ML1 | 2026-03-19 | `ML1_METRIC_APPROVAL.md`, `OKR.md` |
| Assemble gate packet | Project Owner | 2026-03-20 | `VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`, `../APPROVAL_RECORD.md` |

## Resource Plan

### Human Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| ML1 | Approval authority for thresholds, stage gates, and major trade-offs |
| Matthew | Product direction, prioritization, and execution decisions |
| Levine Law | Execution and launch governance support |
| Matthew Holdings | Ownership governance and portfolio-level oversight |

### Systems / Tools
- Product code repository
- Hosting/runtime environment
- Tariff and trade agreement data sources
- Analytics/event tracking
- Issue and incident tracking workspace

### Capacity Notes
- Project remains intentionally small until first launch outcome is achieved.
- Approved budget envelope for this planning packet is `CAD 500`.
- Executing-stage spend and tooling must stay inside approved envelope.
- Any expansion in jurisdictions or features requires explicit ML1 approval.

## Completion Condition
Planning is complete when executing can start with frozen scope, approved thresholds, explicit risk controls, and ML1 gate authorization.
